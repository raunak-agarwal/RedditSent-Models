__label__1	And we're upset since the Democrats would *never* try something as sneaky as this, right?
__label__1	TIL, voluntary slavery by starving people who'd work for food can 'potentially virtually' wipe out unemployment
__label__1	That'd be great if only Ron Paul wasn't A CHRISTIAN!
__label__1	But, but...lowering taxes creates jobs!
__label__1	WHORES!
__label__-1	Well, yeah, but his plan would funnel money to job creators so they can store it safely until they're ready to make a job for one of those guys maybe.
__label__1	"File under ""How the right wing wants to keep government smaller and out of your business."""
__label__1	He has great respect for the office.
__label__1	"I like Romney's advice better - ""borrow from your folks""."
__label__1	Just another responsible gun owner excercising his rights under the 2nd Amendment.
__label__1	What oil spill?
__label__-1	It's a city built on debts and booze... probably.
__label__-1	Cause the whole system is rigged.
__label__1	Thank God Congress is there to look out for our best interests despite what the majority wants!
__label__-1	I have to deal with 64 all the time.
__label__-1	Was he shootin' at some food?
__label__1	But we can just go to the ER, they have to tape us back together.
__label__1	Guys... Guys I know the answer... Lets... double down on our policy and inject tons of money into our failed program!
__label__-1	**I don't remember saying anything about this** + Also isn't the whole idea is of up-voting is to get this stupid message out to the masses?
__label__-1	-Pope Francis
__label__-1	Wooooow this is the first positive thing my state has been in the news for in quite a while.
__label__1	It almost sounds like they are accusing the CIA of being less-than-forthright about their methods... I find this hard to believe
__label__1	its not like the people voted on it or anythin
__label__-1	Things like this make me wonder if nature secretly understands irony.
__label__1	Oh no, Please Saint Elizabeth, only you can save America from the evil Hillary who is personally responsible for everything wrong with the world.
__label__-1	When RW is complaining about their own party - maybe someone in the GOP will listen - I'm guessing not.
__label__-1	Thats cool I hate to GOP too!
__label__-1	Three strikes and the Constitution is out.
__label__-1	Because, Obama
__label__1	There goes Obummer again stomping on small business trying to tell that what to do!
__label__1	shouldnt we be discussing sony and nk?
__label__1	Well that's a shock!
__label__-1	Their spin machine is too worn out from over use.
__label__-1	You have been invited to mod 8chan
__label__1	Yeah, why can't those stupid ****** just shut up like they're supposed to?
__label__-1	So people almost lost their homes over 40 dollars of pot?
__label__-1	Just more proof that the Republican Party is a wholly owned puppet of the Koch Brothers, and similarly oily ilk.
__label__-1	Two faces, two Corinthians.
__label__-1	She clearly struggles to connect coherent thought into words.
__label__1	He's Muslim?
__label__1	This is clearly a vast right wing conspiracy to discredit her for perfectly ordinary and acceptable fees
__label__1	yea but then it would put the health insurance companies out of business and that means job losses.
__label__1	But Bernie is attacking her everyday and trying to destroy her.
__label__1	"Bernie should say: ""Enough is enough,"" which is a magical incantation that has a real world effect on people."
__label__1	What a crook
__label__1	"But they ""won"" Iowa and NH is next to Vermont.. and they're about to be saved by the Hispanic and African-American voters.. Why fire people on the verge of their triumph?"
__label__-1	I guess it gets lonely in the closet
__label__1	The Sanders Scare: Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid.
__label__1	And that's why I'm voting Republican.
__label__1	Yeaaah... That's gonna hurt Sanders...
__label__1	Because exactly the same people are commenting from that time.
__label__-1	Since when is the Daily Caller a legitimate news source?
__label__1	What could possibly go wrong?
__label__1	I'm so sad that I decided to play video games instead of watching this mess.
__label__1	They should have to wear a Star and Crescent on their arm so we know who they are.
__label__1	Just another outlier.
__label__-1	This was an oddly phrased tittle: my thoughts
__label__1	TIL Trump is an Anti-Semite
__label__1	I'm officially an atheist now.
__label__-1	I'm not really a fan of any of the candidates, but I can't believe people seriously want Trump as President, completely insane choice.
__label__-1	Because no one is representing their interests.
__label__1	I'm sure he's just warning the good people of Nevada about the Judo-Bolshevik conspiracy.
__label__-1	I still can't believe how funny it is that sanders got the only white NAACP President to endorse him.
__label__-1	Pretty sure they could use the money they're wasting on the wall instead of the meager foreign aid.
__label__1	The National Review has been so dead on with their predictions about Trump that I am sure this one would work.
__label__1	The one that stays in its 'Free Speech Zone' three counties away from the politician they're protesting?
__label__-1	Looks like they're paying for the wall.
__label__1	Good news for people who love small government and local rights.
__label__1	Just a fresh load of bits and bytes, encapsulated for convenience.
__label__-1	"Reddit ""no she's not, here's this shit poll conducted on buzzfeed that says sanders is winning"""
__label__-1	Yeah hi I wrote the quick story you're linking to, if you could refrain from putting racist quotes in my mouth that'd be so great.
__label__-1	His voting record shows this, reddit doesn't care.
__label__1	Oh another anti-Hillary story on Reddit, how shocking.
__label__1	Thanks for showing me the light, Oliver!
__label__1	That's it, i'm voting for Bernie!
__label__-1	Sadly, hiding under beds scared of dark bogeymen is at an alltime high among Republican voters.
__label__1	Guys don't forget it was only about Illegal immigrants
__label__1	I don't know why trump keeps attacking Obama, it's not like he can be convicted of treason, because he's not even an American citizen.
__label__1	But it's okay, everyone, Hillary was the one that wanted more war.
__label__1	She also visited the White House many times and spoke with Obama!
__label__-1	If only all these violations actually meant anything other than headline fodder.
__label__1	I'm sure this poll is 100% accurate and in no way slanted.
__label__-1	"I'm sure she responsibly put the documents in a sealed envelope, handed them to an aide and said, ""Make sure you keep that close to your vest,"" while winking in a pronounced fashion."
__label__-1	Where are the Left-Wing Billionaires?
__label__-1	How does this make America great again?
__label__1	But i thought he was such a revolutionary!
__label__-1	I'm sure he reached this conclusion after thoroughly studying evidence.
__label__1	Looks like Angie knows her place.
__label__1	God I'm so sick of democrats making our country so much more partisan.
__label__1	Yeah but it's not fair for Hillary to get them since Trump never attended his
__label__1	The best people
__label__-1	Its all part of his 153-D Chess strategy to bring those numbers down so low that when there is a 1-month minor spurt he can claim how great he is at it.
__label__-1	Does this stuff really sell newspapers?
__label__1	I'm so upset over this.
__label__-1	Doesn't pretty much every service provider on the web sell your data?
__label__1	Yeah but why would we listen to physicians?
__label__1	Huffington Post is a well respected and reputable source for all things.
__label__-1	"""There's no varmit poontang like dead varmit poontang...I always say."""
__label__1	A litmus test of proper whiteness?
__label__1	Only on the Jews, but Hey, they don't really count, right?
__label__-1	Somewhere Clinton Watts is smirking.
__label__1	Americans should totally be more gung ho to squeeze even more productivity gains out of themselves so they can not be compensated for it and see 95% of economic gains go to the wealthiest 1% of the population.
__label__-1	Alabama, congratulations on moving forward to 1979 and best of luck with that cultural revolution.
__label__1	Well, that's OK, just so long as he keeps funding the Affordable Care Act!
__label__1	Tell me how you really feel
__label__1	When in Rome?
__label__1	yeah all the videos of people in hospitals we saw are all fake and paid actors.
__label__-1	ummmm, awesome!
__label__-1	Good for him, it's a really nice place.
__label__1	If the MOAB doesn't rally the country and distract them from this, then maybe nuking North Korea will?
__label__1	It's just a coincidence I'm sure!
__label__-1	The music just hides the sounds of furious mastrubation and teary climax from the panel.
__label__-1	I may not like em, but at least he is going somewhere relevant.
__label__1	I'm sure the right would love to bring corporate regulation back to what it was in the founders' day.
__label__1	They're not lobbyists if they're on your side.
__label__1	Strange because it doesn't work in any other first world countries.
__label__-1	It's quite remarkable how all the checks and balances and power abuse laws turned out to be duds once they were actually put to test.
__label__-1	As a democrat l can say his first 100 days are a success.
__label__1	What a shocker
__label__-1	Seattle...continuing to do it right :)
__label__-1	Thanks to Viagra
__label__1	This is fake news because we all know Trump is a warrior for free speech and free expression
__label__-1	Oh no, that sucks.
__label__-1	They had the most beautiful chocolate cake
__label__1	And the hilarity continues.......
__label__1	MAGAs
__label__1	Hahahahaha motor city mad man and grizzly mom siiiiiiick burn bro that was fucking epic!
__label__1	No, just lynching skills
__label__1	Nationalizing whole industries like the energy sector work so well, right
__label__1	"Using the new congressional line of thinking, they have ""access"" to live somewhere else, So why not just leave?"
__label__1	But he didn't offer him a beautiful piece of chocolate cake?
__label__-1	Nobody knew being President could be so complicated.
__label__1	Trump has cut out the middle-men that past administrations have used as their buffer between them and the media, and instead he convenes with the media directly, saving tax dollars!
__label__1	Nice of politico to cut off her response ensuring fair balance.
__label__1	He carried the Russian vote, this is fake news
__label__1	WTF Reddit, always trying to blame Trump for Obama's mistakes
__label__-1	yeah no shit
__label__1	but but but the other day fox was saying this was 95%.....I don't know who I should believe
__label__1	Now maybe they can get to the bottom of all that Obama spying on trump.
__label__-1	Do people honestly believe Watters should lose his job for this joke?
__label__1	Well, what business was it of the reporter's?
__label__1	*That damn Putin told me being President would be just like being on The Apprentice*
__label__-1	The Republican Party, the most dangerous, ideologically bankrupt organization in human history
__label__1	Why does it matter, he was just an unpaid intern that Trump never even met
__label__-1	"The ever reliable and unbiased ""trump hired hookers to piss on obama's mattress"" news source: Buzzfeed"
__label__-1	This is not about test scores...this is about profits.
__label__-1	I bet a lot less people would apathetic if less retirees were in congress telling younger people they don't matter.
__label__1	But then it's Obama's fault for not vetting Pence properly!
__label__1	Yeah, it just works out so badly for the average worker in those countries.
__label__1	I'll bet they are racists and hate black people just like all the rest of the Republicans.
__label__-1	YellowCakeWalk, where have you been amigo?
__label__-1	HuffPo denounces capitalism?
__label__1	Yes, the massive standing Norwegian army is going to take over.
__label__1	The article wasn't biased at all.
__label__-1	contempt of court?
__label__-1	Why is anyone shocked when a guy referred to as an Etch-a-sketch by his own campaign staff changes his position?
__label__-1	I would love to have this as a question during the presidential debate.
__label__-1	YES WE CAN!
__label__1	Oh please we want to hear more of their fear and hate mongering and lies, we especially want more lies.
__label__-1	Indeed, bring back the unionized refs.
__label__1	Really classy guy.
__label__1	*allegedly*
__label__1	Hey America, if you're nervous about terrorists, how about you start meeting their demands instead of bombing their home countries.
__label__-1	Much better than drinking too much, being sick off your ass and feeling like shit all the next day or ya know dying.
__label__-1	Shouldn't that read 92% of Congress claims to be Christians.
__label__1	But don't forget that both parties are the same.
__label__-1	Did Bush's grandaddy bank for Obama too?
__label__-1	Telling you now GOP: Do the exact OPPOSITE of what this guy says and you might have a chance.
__label__1	You know what would fix that... scrapping inheritance taxes... Thanks GOP
__label__-1	Was that the deportable that GOP fuck wit was talking about?
__label__1	I'm sure its a coincidence.
__label__1	Given two corpses, one is bound to look a little more lifelike.
__label__1	WOW WHAT A HERO
__label__1	explanation for the low voter turn out on the democratic side right here
__label__-1	well once they started shaming middle class white males.... im not surprised they lost many of their votes.
__label__-1	Good thing all those voter ID laws got passed to prevent machines from changing your vote.
__label__1	Yeah and Martin O'Malley should be energy secretary
__label__1	but Nate Silver underestimated Trump, so clearly nothing he says can ever be trusted again.
__label__-1	As culturally latino as Taco Bell.
__label__-1	if only a portion of these 45,000 petitioners took initiative to actually vote instead of do their usual and complain.
__label__1	Jeez oh man, looks like I need a new candidate.
__label__1	Sounds like a great marriage.
__label__-1	But when someone says Bernie's free college for all is Just not possible, it gets down-voted to oblivion.
__label__-1	Bye shitbag.
__label__-1	how do you think trump must feel?
__label__1	Ah, the age old Christian values of discrimination... Christ would be so pleased.
__label__1	This is a sexist article.
__label__1	I demand that Sanders release his speeches to Castro.
__label__1	The only reason she's supporting Clinton apparently is 'she has the right genitalia, and Bernie is too old' What a rational thought out reason to vote for someone
__label__-1	Megyn Kelly is gonna be there?
__label__1	"You mean ""misremembering"""
__label__-1	yeah, its getting out of control, and if these protesters actually have to face real world consequences for their actions, it will thin the herd considerably normally i would say just kick them out, but its just gone beyond acceptable, and its getting even worse start arresting them, let them know if you break the law, you face the consequences
__label__1	But he's not electable!
__label__-1	Massachusetts regrets voting for her
__label__1	But the mainstream media told me that Trump is the worst out of all the candidates, and he is the one responsible for the bad image the republican party, and Ted Cruz doesn't have anyone like David Duke endorsing him, just Kevin Swanson
__label__-1	WHO GIVES A SHIT
__label__-1	To be fair the presidential election is the only thing that matters for them in North Carolina after the congressional districts were ~~racially segregated~~ *gerrymandered*
__label__1	I'm sure this is a great moral victory for Bernie that will propel him to beat Hillary
__label__-1	we iz legion we r annonymoose
__label__-1	I think it's time we give a nickname to Trump's 'voice in his head'
__label__-1	Great, the last thing I need to see on TV is Elijah Cummings bitching about shit.
__label__-1	Top lel
__label__1	TIL the millions of people who voted for Sanders are all beta-male college kid stoners who still use bean bags.
__label__-1	They're at Shea and Pallisades which is actually pretty close to the Mayo Clinic hospital (4 mins away and Shea is one of the few ways to get there) That said, the side of the road that drivers would be taking to get to the hospital campus from the other side of the protest appears to be mostly open.
__label__-1	Shutdown capitalism too!
__label__1	Us this before or after Obama takes all our guns, and declare himself emperor
__label__-1	by being the single most divisive politician next to darnold dump in the country
__label__1	Big shock
__label__-1	The sad part is that most Cruz supporters will enthusiastically support this crap.
__label__1	Why would anyone distrust a government?
__label__-1	Cross between Wallace and Perot.
__label__-1	Definitely explains Merkel.
__label__-1	She is such a piece of garbage
__label__-1	I think the election should be about policy...
__label__-1	A giant roach motel with a big, beautiful door.
__label__-1	If the media did that she'd pay them less
__label__1	I'm sure this applies to corporate welfare recipients too
__label__1	The way god intended!
__label__-1	Fat chicks are usually pretty witty.
__label__-1	So when are we gonna riot and fucking take this country back?
__label__-1	I truly believe this who ordeal has been caused by the selfishness of the
__label__1	"What is it with you reality-based people and your obsession with ""facts""?"
__label__1	What a tremendously well-written and unbiased article.
__label__-1	But they still have the backing of billionaires and the M$M.
__label__-1	If he had his way: abortions would be illegal, creationism taught in schools, and no environmental regulations.
__label__1	If they want a good education then their parents shouldn't have made bad life choices, maybe they should get a job and pay for their own socialistic education.
__label__-1	Too bad a lot of us cannot vote for him for real with all the voter suppression.
__label__-1	When Jews see you coming running away, you should take the hint.
__label__-1	I see the papers, now where are the rules?
__label__1	They're called buses and they're pretty reliable.
__label__1	I'm sure he thought thus up all by himself and acted alone.
__label__-1	He is actually part Irish.
__label__-1	I am sick to death of these posts time and time again just so you can get front page karma whoring
__label__1	If we could only stamp out sin completely we'd never have bad weather again.
__label__-1	And received an 8% return!
__label__-1	Will they give us back our money then?
__label__-1	As a married woman, it astounds me that any other woman would marry any of these nimrods who need those instructions on how to talk to our gender with the respect they expect for themselves.
__label__1	I am sure they were working real hard to catch terrorist
__label__-1	It's increasingly more of a spectacle than an information source.
__label__1	Yes, but it doesn't involve shaming women or scaring teens, so it doesn't count.
__label__1	Obama is making me pay for your prostituting child.
__label__-1	Maybe not, but it's a very good first step.
__label__1	Sensationalization in progress: 5-Year-Old Suspended for Hand Gun.
__label__1	It's ok, black people can't be racist, only whites can.
__label__1	Yes and never mind that Christians drink *while in church*, they also happen to have the least drunk countries in the world...
__label__-1	Could some one compare the proposed law against dangerous bikes against Wyoming laws for guns?
__label__-1	Not the first time Alabama found a way to deny a people of a civil right.
__label__-1	Is this only for one state, or the whole USA?
__label__1	I don't want to live in a world where a nice white guy can't make sweeping generalizations loaded with casual racism and not get away with it!
__label__-1	Yeah, cuz fuck democracy right?
__label__-1	"Thats right...thats why we just saw a Rachel Maddow loving Atheist kill 3 muslims over a parking space...because he wasnt religious or right wing, it wasnt a hate crime...It was the right wing that rioted and burned down a town and had one of its supporters kill 2 nyc policemen...What was the last ""right wing"" domestic terrorist act?"
__label__-1	"Those fleet-footed urban youth are at it again, it seems, trying to thief our war dollars for ""food."""
__label__1	really surprises me that this kindof behavior is happening in chicago
__label__1	The Fox News propaganda machine is working as planned...Buwahahahahaha!
__label__-1	Better call in some air strikes.
__label__-1	Unemployment is at 5 percent.
__label__1	They usually vote the wrong way anyways.
__label__-1	Yep, and we all know what direction that's going in
__label__1	Yeah, because all Trump supporters are white
__label__1	She's just like us!
__label__1	It's her turn sexist!
__label__-1	Pretty much Bill.
__label__1	What is every one bitching about, those were made in America bombs.
__label__1	lol Yeah, because this is a super important issue!
__label__-1	what a shock
__label__1	Fucking blue state commie socialists
__label__1	We need a redheaded quadrapelegic who was left handed who is genderfluid.
__label__-1	She made a boo-boo?
__label__1	Yeah, but only white people read Time.
__label__1	What a truly despicable thing to say!
__label__1	Mods please remove this.... It clearly isn't political
__label__1	Yeah, but he blew her the fuck out in the debate and going to the Vatican will win him all the Catholic votes since that's how Catholics function so he's going to win New York easily.
__label__-1	No pictures of the 'crowd' eh.
__label__1	He's a millennial, obviously.
__label__-1	Because they had to *stand in line*
__label__-1	I'll laugh at this when Trump wins.
__label__1	"The low voter turnout has to be because so many Sanders ballots were ""lost"" right?"
__label__1	But anyone who notices is just a pie in the sky berni bot who doesnt know how the 'real world' works so its fine.
__label__-1	Supporters understand that he does not have real shot, this is no longer about just him.
__label__1	TIL Joe's into pegging.
__label__-1	women don't know what common sense or reason are.
__label__1	"Just ""New York"" values again..."
__label__1	\#ThanksHillary
__label__-1	Well....nothing involving my state and the governor is ever good.
__label__-1	Considering that so much voter suppression and election fraud is at play nationwide, especially in poor areas, this is not surprising by any means.
__label__1	but remember, its the Bernie supporters that are the problem!
__label__-1	I suppose this is called dirty politics.
__label__-1	This is great news for Sanders!
__label__1	"Cruz, after a late night binge-watching the Blues Brothers, announces, ""we're on a mission from God"" Sorta"
__label__-1	Anybody that has molested a child in any given time day or life should be fed to 1,000 wolves and i wouldnt even want the wolves to get sick!
__label__1	Since this is Russian propaganda and not American I guess she has done nothing wrong.
__label__-1	It's like if I read your comment, punched myself in the eye out of rage and then held you accountable.
__label__1	But I thought money bought elections, which is why we need to get rid of Citizen's United?
__label__1	Is it just me, or has Sputnik News really upped the quality of content submission around here?
__label__-1	Interesting one...I want to see the answers on this one.
__label__-1	Yeah but isn't it only a side effect of them attempting to benefit themselves?
__label__-1	"Fox ""news"" sure is good at finding black people who hate white people."
__label__1	Yay for editorialized headline.
__label__1	But we have lots of body scanners and Big Brother is watching us ever so closely to keep us safe.
__label__-1	An parody becomes even more difficult in the world of the Republican.
__label__-1	the car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
__label__-1	Jon Kyl was not intended to be a factual statement
__label__1	what's wrong with trainspotting license plates?
__label__1	This makes sense, since the middle class having more money act as the job destroyers.
__label__1	Military must be full of kooks.
__label__1	I find this thread to be full of anti-Semitism!
__label__-1	I always think it's cute when liberals try to act like they care about soldiers or how they're treated.
__label__1	Obviously the Republican leadership is more generous in helping the less than fortunate Democrats in their counties than those managed by Democrats.
__label__-1	This should just be treason.
__label__1	Yeah, the royal family are so powerful it's such a scandal that they exist.
__label__1	It's a governmental conspiracy to force us all into marriage.
__label__-1	If he wants a recount, he's going to have to pay for it.
__label__1	Who knew outsourcing your campaign's IT jobs to the Geek Squad would end so badly?
__label__-1	Do these people even realize that the red states, their audience, are the prime users of food stamps.
__label__-1	It's really rich, for him to be so sneeringly dismissive of the idea of the GOP breaking ranks when you've got GOPers coming right out and announcing that they're breaking ranks.
__label__-1	I kinda agree with this, if you need to get rid of a building and nobody is willing to demolish it, then allowing people to play with fireworks indoors isn't all that crazy.
__label__-1	PNAC
__label__-1	A lot of people are not doctors.
__label__-1	After the fifth different girl with an untreated yeast infection.
__label__-1	Bankruptcy and limited liability better not protect these negligent criminals from prosecution.
__label__-1	The corrupt NCAA cartel needs someone to fight them and their obscene profits.
__label__-1	I don't blame Cruz for being a real life Elmer Gantry, I blame the idiots who voted for his dumb ass.
__label__-1	The NSA and FISC are James Clapper's accomplices.
__label__1	America, starting to make parts of the Third World look good!
__label__1	It would have to be a legitimate rape tho
__label__1	Finally, someone to bring some reason and class to the GOP field.
__label__1	Because forcing people to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich is fair.
__label__-1	Some believe these new activities would consist of...being lazy.
__label__1	Oh my God, the huffington post hasn't reported on this yet!
__label__1	Maybe he saw a picture of the cameraman being rescued.
__label__1	That's 2 things too many!
__label__-1	Uh-oh
__label__1	Bernie needs to bring his supporters to heel!
__label__1	Bernie said it so it must be true!
__label__-1	"He (and you) must have read ""Games People Play""."
__label__1	Thankfully congress is controlled by the democrats
__label__1	Yup...Trump is certainly to the left of Hillary
__label__-1	98% of the tweets from Bernie bros
__label__1	Found the shill!
__label__1	What about his free speech rights?
__label__1	Nice to see those abstinence-only programs are finally paying off.
__label__-1	Not Republican, and not Democrat.
__label__1	"""Clinton adversary"" Oh, so an impartial observer!"
__label__1	Oh, but I thought that there wasn't any evidence at all and they were just about to drop the whole thing!
__label__-1	haha shit just got real!
__label__1	You'll get Clinton's transcripts when Trump is damn good and ready to release them!
__label__1	Its alright he know what he's doing, he's rich!

__label__-1	Bullets are cheaper anyway
__label__1	a real Woodrow Wilson that Trump.
__label__1	Then why are all the Californians moving to Austin?
__label__-1	Kansas is probably the best and most obvious example of how trickle-down economics destroy the country.

__label__-1	"I'm not Trump supporter but I'm pretty sure Politifucked is about as impartial as the jury in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"""
__label__-1	At this point I would rather volunteer for the Trump campaign than vote for Hillary.
__label__-1	It's simple, keep your word.
__label__1	I hope they are all going through background checks like we do here.
__label__1	More non-pie-in-the-sky, real-world observations from Bernie.
__label__1	RIGHT WING CONSPIRACIES.
__label__1	She is only being singled out because of her gender.
__label__-1	But that doesn't prove he wasn't qualified.
__label__-1	I'm sure she will get right on that.
__label__1	The FEC rules are just a right-wing conspiracy.
__label__-1	Someone learned them the hard way in '08.
__label__-1	"""University"""
__label__-1	By rigging things in her favor, I assume.
__label__1	If only they had murdered more people, maybe communism would have worked this time!
__label__1	She doesn't *need* NJ, plebes ^
__label__1	Yeah that sounds legit.
__label__-1	"Isn't ""Jew-hating anti-Semite"" redundant?"
__label__1	Americans could have saved the money to buy bullets to kill more Muslim in Middle-East
__label__1	Foxnews did not say so, so it is not true
__label__-1	This guy's getting desperate.
__label__1	So why aren't they buying robots from china then?
__label__-1	And after that, we can just make knives really expensive.
__label__-1	How come those who refer to others as 'gun nuts' are often the most fanatical bunch?
__label__1	Well, someone has to create those jobs, don't they?
__label__-1	Good
__label__-1	pansy
__label__-1	Not everything is a conspiracy dude, we're not ready to believe you.
__label__-1	Someday rich white people will overcome this bigotry.
__label__1	It's definitely not mental health of individuals.
__label__1	"But there's a ""War on Christmas"" out there started by them dang godless liberal commies!"
__label__-1	Because smart people with funds will be able to convince others of something especially when they have time and no opposition.
__label__1	At the risk of sounding crass... In curious to see how quickly the GOP restores the cuts since they ended up hurting a corporations profits.
__label__1	Think of how much money could have been saved if they had only made a run to McDonalds for state dinners with visiting heads of state.
__label__1	2 parties are the same
__label__1	And so much freedom was accomplished.
__label__-1	And Minnesota just keeps gaining
__label__-1	She's still a thing?
__label__-1	"I'm still blown away that the party of ""personal freedoms"" and ""lack of government intervention"" are the people who think government should make people criminals for using something put here by their white Judeo-Christian god."
__label__1	Good thing that war in Iraq magically paid for itself with oil or something.
__label__1	Lets hope he can some day reach the level of respect as the previous administration
__label__-1	I am going out on a limb and guessing that this is what happens when the federal government has a shit ton of military equipment that is no longer in use overseas and the local police needs cheap vehicles for events that require something more than a normal squad car.
__label__1	Especially a plant God created
__label__1	But Netanyahu says the deal will threaten Israel's survival, he's never wrong!
__label__1	You don't support going to war, you don't support the troops.
__label__-1	If you want to see your incomes stop falling you should call your representative and oppose the expansion of H1-B visas which are driving down wages.
__label__1	Yeah but their freedom rate is at an all time low
__label__-1	Use credible sources.
__label__-1	Well cool, now they can cut what's left of welfare to make up for the tax loss.
__label__1	Not while there are people with Crohn's disease using pot as medicine to imprison!
__label__-1	On one hand, it's very pathetic and quite horrifying that the majority of children born to women under 30 are in single parent households, on the other, this is a very wrong-headed attempt to try to deal with that issue.
__label__1	Also said that he reads Playboy for the articles and they don't pollute to increase bottom-line, putting all that pollution out in the world is its own reward.
__label__1	Remember plebes, your vote matters!
__label__1	Impeach Obama!
__label__-1	LOL, wnd.
__label__-1	No shit.
__label__-1	Hopefully this will prove to be true, once he has Melania on the first-lady track.
__label__1	Obviously, because it's just Trump pointing out how easily our politicians are for sale.
__label__-1	Katy Perry is NOT GAY.
__label__1	But she didn't do it intentionally so it's OK.
__label__1	I wonder which half.
__label__1	TRUMP LOVES SLAVERY.
__label__1	Secret service agent found dead from apparent suicide
__label__-1	Snowden should be completely investigated and all of the facts should come out before we pass judgement.
__label__1	Richard Dawkins - Loved him on Family Fued
__label__1	Clearly because she's innocent.
__label__1	"But if I type in ""Gary Johnson beats Trump and Clinton"" into google, I've got dozens of polls saying otherwise!"
__label__1	Well, the media sure pushed that story.. what a surprise!
__label__1	But those tax breaks for corporations will trickle down
__label__-1	What does Judge Joe Brown have to say?
__label__1	But she said there would be no more shoes to drop from the FBI.
__label__-1	This attitude is a good reason for kicking the most hardcore supporters of Bernie out of the Democratic party.
__label__-1	No one cares, vote for who you want to vote for.
__label__1	Because the GOP isn't known for bigotry and discrimination.
__label__1	Well it's good that a low-key, quiet-spoken celebrity known for being even-tempered and logical is supporting Trump.
__label__-1	Emails about drone strikes sent to ~~Clinton's personal email~~ everyone who was watching Hillary's very public server.
__label__1	"""what difference does it make?!"""
__label__-1	Just another low-information Black voter!
__label__1	I can think of a few names
__label__-1	If Trump had said this every station would be talking about it lmao
__label__-1	Wait... who is buying guns with no questions asked?
__label__1	50 people shooting in a dark, packed club while drinking would have made this a much better situation.
__label__-1	Blaming shit on video games, music, movies, or tv shows is the height of stupidity.
__label__-1	Why do we even allow civilians to have armor?
__label__-1	In other news, Donald Trump's comments about women become increasingly aggressive.
__label__-1	She learned a valuable lesson about power.
__label__1	Say hello to your future king.
__label__-1	our knight in shining bronzer.
__label__1	"They directly asked for $1.00 donations and removed the thousands of huge donations and create this number for ONE MONTH, also the line that rewrote headline is from mentions ""according to the campaign"" OH YEA seems legit."
__label__-1	He bought paper from Dunder Miflinn
__label__1	That TRAITOR.
__label__-1	How many liberals was that?
__label__-1	I think John Lewis should get to beat his ass.
__label__-1	If we elected people based on being qualified we would have never elected a jr senator!
__label__-1	Maybe we should rely on our own rational thought to come to the conclusion that he's a dick and clueless?
__label__-1	Big fucking deal *jerk off motion*
__label__1	Yeah, because that's how geopolitics works.
__label__-1	She's already testified.
__label__1	Clearly he meant something horrifically racist that just curdles the blood of anyone who actually hears it.
__label__1	No one saw that coming
__label__1	He was lied to.
__label__-1	Yes it would be a big deal - get your head out of the left right paradigm and start asking yourself if as an American it's wrong or right.
__label__-1	I noticed that the comments were closed at that website.
__label__-1	I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
__label__1	See, the free market always makes the right choice.
__label__1	This is why we need to get rid of the EPA and let the free market handle things.
__label__1	This is horrible because without VAWA violence against women becomes legal and socially acceptable.
__label__1	Making Texas proud!
__label__1	We don't need no fucking Arab socialist preaching anything.
__label__1	Sounds like they feel that boy has gotten a little uppity.
__label__-1	So much circle jerking going on in this thread.
__label__1	Oh ya the Feds will definitely get right on that
__label__1	ah yes, another article super relevant to today's current events.
__label__-1	"No, I believe that would be the Republicans that excel at saying things divorced from reality, aka ""Making shit up."""
__label__1	We definitely need more intelligent comments like these.
__label__1	I hope this shuts up everyone who thinks Southerners are a bunch of trigger-happy idiots who are filled with fear.
__label__1	What a surprise!
__label__1	But, you know, the government doesn't create jobs.
__label__1	But they made an *investment*, in lobbying!
__label__1	Gee, I wonder if that's why James Clapper didn't get into any trouble for lying to Congress
__label__-1	"""Now"""
__label__-1	Get a degree: earn a minimum wage job
__label__-1	Ted Cruz advocates special security for hate groups, interesting!
__label__-1	How about NO.
__label__1	Man, the dramatic music and cheap effects sure make this video seem professional and non-conspiratorial
__label__-1	While that may be so, there are still troubling and legitimate questions as to why Ted Cruz won't disclose a long form birth certificate.
__label__1	Well, that is the christian thing to do.
__label__1	"It is ok because that money hidden away in ""social not for profit"" organizations to elect Republicans is ....white, of course."
__label__-1	Newflash - Bush hasn't been president for years.
__label__1	Yeah, but what lesson does that teach these worthless vagrants?
__label__1	Bush's are never to blame for their failures.
__label__1	She'll meet with the FBI once everyone else meets with the FBI.
__label__-1	"I'm gonna guess this is public and all they say is ""sry we fucked up your campaing"""
__label__1	Well since Hillary said it, it must be true.
__label__-1	Because OJ Simpson was too busy.
__label__-1	Thought she said it was an interview not in estivation.
__label__-1	I wonder if this restaurant owner does
__label__1	She does have the best record of transparency.
__label__-1	Welcome to the next eight years.
__label__1	Watch it Walker, you keep saying nice things about Hillary and you won't get that sweet VP some people think you should get.
__label__-1	Bernie officially sells out.
__label__-1	Maybe he should just stop showing up and see if anyone joins him.
__label__-1	Why shouldn't women have the same Selective Service obligations as men?
__label__1	How can you be against it if it's all secret
__label__1	Thank you Republicans, always doing the important work that will impact the lives of the majority of Americans.
__label__1	They should have just called them Commie schools, be proud of who you are Kansas!
__label__-1	"Giuliani must say what ""crime problem"" he's talking about -- since the crime rate in America has been on the decline for 25 years, and hasn't been this low since the 1970s."
__label__1	Keep voting for the lesser of two evils people, nothing bad will ever happen!
__label__-1	All these Trump supporters crying now because they were hoping Bernie would throw a wrench into things.
__label__1	Misleading title because OH and PA have no black people.
__label__1	ZOMG SO RACIST
__label__1	Maybe blue balls are why they are so violent.
__label__-1	I think Hillary entertains the thought of losing .
__label__-1	geesh, does this sub get anything right?
__label__-1	The fuck do atheists have to do with family life?
__label__1	Fair and Balanced as always.
__label__-1	If cops is be raycis, how come they're having a cookout with BLM?
__label__-1	Whelp ... anyone else for Gary Johnson, seeings how both major parties have driven off the progressive cliff?
__label__-1	And just like the primaries, the Bernie Bro's will fail to show up.
__label__-1	Cool
__label__-1	Is Bill Running for President?
__label__1	If they hate being poor they will try to make money.
__label__-1	Ladies and Gentlemen, your 2016 Democratic Party!
__label__-1	That's hot as fuck
__label__1	yeah because it's only the convention causing this bump and nothing else
__label__-1	I dont see how anything in this article proves this.
__label__1	...and we wonder why she hasn't held a press conference since 2015.
__label__-1	Hillary Victory Fund it seems
__label__1	Unified party people
__label__1	Because it matters so much more than our sick corrupted democracy!
__label__1	Sexist much
__label__-1	Trump hasn't even gotten *started* on her.
__label__1	Because it's her turn!
__label__1	I'm shocked, shocked that a dude who's been in politics for 30 odd years, but never in the democratic party nor gave the democratic party any support during that time wasn't well received with open arms by democrats!
__label__-1	This far into the election and she still lacks any brand or message... It's vote for me because it's me... Lame
__label__1	Glad to have Herman Cain's opinion on the matter.
__label__-1	Downvote it so it's not true
__label__1	*Unity*
__label__-1	weak, ignorant people are easier to control.
__label__-1	Boy oh *boy* those coming debates with Trump will be fun.
__label__-1	Wasn't Politico one of the outlets with writers under DNC control/influence?
__label__-1	"""It's just a prank, bro."""
__label__-1	Regardless of your politics, these are some pretty powerful images that tell a story all in themselves.
__label__1	How comforting.
__label__1	If you guys would just vote for her, she'd show you!
__label__-1	That's what most of the event is comprised of, so yes.
__label__-1	Pretty sad article :/
__label__1	But...but...I thought a corporation was an individual.
__label__1	Remember believing something is true makes it true
__label__1	rekt
__label__-1	Only in America is this an excuse to skip a debate.
__label__1	It's okay though because it's her turn.
__label__1	Between this and deflate gate ESPN should have real great content this season.
__label__-1	Already debunked by politifact Sorry spinners
__label__1	He will annex it first, then it already will be part of Russia
__label__-1	Does anyone really believe her?
__label__1	This is shaping up to be a fantastic week for him.
__label__1	This is why I love living in Tampa.
__label__1	Thank you, Glen Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Fox News for contributing your productive and thought provoking citizens to constructive town hall debates about Nazi health-care.
__label__-1	Fox News should be called the back stabbing rat fucking network.
__label__1	Yes it is,but ut's a great way for the wealthy to cull the less desirables.
__label__-1	Someone give this man a cookie!
__label__-1	Is your history teacher's blog reddit?
__label__-1	What is he doing about it then?
__label__-1	Isn't this Al Gore's new network?
__label__1	Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Fox will never stoop to that wacko idea.
__label__1	It's the fags fault!
__label__1	Yeah, cause auto manufacturers never get sued!
__label__-1	More Palin Derangement Syndrome.
__label__-1	I don't have much to say right here except that this makes me happy.
__label__-1	Tax churches next so we can have uninhibited integration of church and state
__label__1	Because anecdotal stories *always* trumps facts which could be found be researching police records.
__label__1	Sounds like a good time to gerrymander!
__label__1	Damn you Obama!
__label__-1	Gohmert pile?
__label__1	"But it's all okay because 'independent expenditures' don't ""give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption""."
__label__-1	And it's not even a record.
__label__1	No one saw this coming when he was appointed
__label__-1	Clearly the solution to this is to elect *more* Bible-thumping science-denying Republicans, right, American South?
__label__-1	Or just lift the cap and be done with it.
__label__1	Hey religion caused a massive AIDS epidemic in Indiana when they one down here but at least whores will be forced to suffer!
__label__1	Jamie Dimon is better than the rest of us, his wealth proves it!
__label__1	I'm sure this post will rocket to the top!
__label__1	but nowhere does he mention deep sea fishing rights
__label__1	But Reaganomics, that's the good stuff!
__label__1	Well people say they want another Ronald Reagan.... This is probably as close as we will get.
__label__1	Why can't CNN be unbiased like breitbart?
__label__1	Especially someone who is a billionaire that hasn't donated to Hillary Clinton, what a travesty
__label__-1	That is sooooo fucked up
__label__-1	so...?
__label__1	But he said he had many friends in his presidential speech!
__label__-1	Rockefeller Republican in black face.
__label__1	All billionaires are shills - except for Trump, he's a self-made man
__label__-1	Trump2016
__label__-1	Europe is already being flooded with migrants.
__label__1	I'm sure their bodies have a way to just shut that whole thing down.
__label__-1	And what about the people who don't have a millionaire daddy who will support them financially if they quit?
__label__-1	What happened to his hair?
__label__1	I thought the GOP didn't agree with abortion
__label__1	Naw Assange is all about transparency, he doesn't hand pick these to be political or anything.
__label__-1	LOL Can we keep giving our crazies to the other side?
__label__-1	should we also consider images of the declaration of independence racist because it was written by thomas jefferson, who owned slaves?
__label__1	*That sounds exactly like what somebody who was trying to rig the election would say...* ^
__label__-1	I would actually honestly pay good money to watch Trump chase a feisty little Pomeranian around.
__label__-1	Why is this piece of human trash even getting media attention?
__label__1	There is such a long tradition of presidential candidates releasing transcripts of their speeches as private citizens.
__label__-1	So, if there's a media blackout, how is it that we can read about it via media?
__label__1	Having an economy that was 90% oil had nothing to do with it.
__label__-1	Insurance rates rise?
__label__-1	You mean the same regressive conservative governments installed by the West?
__label__-1	so the Media all just get together as one entity and make public statements now?
__label__1	I'm sure it's just CTR paying off the lot of them.
__label__1	Get your British spelling out of my American election
__label__1	Hey, if you support the 2nd amendment, you're a white supremacist now.
__label__1	I bet Caroline Kennedy found the joke particularly hilarious.
__label__-1	"Considering Trump was very ""Low energy"" at his rally earlier, it's pretty clear someone talked to him."
__label__-1	For a guy who always tells it like it is, he sure needs translated after the fact at lot.
__label__1	Only the emails of the DNC hack are important though!
__label__-1	Trump is the best thing that ever happened to Hillary.
__label__1	"Liberal media bias changed the word ""literally"" to mean literal"
__label__-1	I'm bringing the punch.
__label__1	Can't believe Obummer hasn't done anything to stop ISIS.
__label__1	Because they were mean to her.
__label__-1	O'Brian?
__label__1	3756D QUANTUM GALACTIC SPACE CHESS GUYS
__label__1	another rigged poll!
__label__1	Yeah, no indication at all that the more voters learn about her the less likely they'll be to vote for her.
__label__-1	I usually disagree with everything Obama says, but he actually has a point here.
__label__-1	If we would apply those standards to all current US americans we would have to deport the GOP
__label__1	And now trump is a lock to win California!
__label__1	Wow, almost 14%!
__label__-1	they can't be still in despair, they are definitely at full blown schadenfreude
__label__-1	Well most of them are not voting for Hillary that's for sure.
__label__-1	But I thought that cutting taxes guaranteed job growth!
__label__1	"for how often obama ""breaks the law' you'd think the gop would impeach, its not like they hold the house AND senate."
__label__1	Because the free press is so accurate and unbiased.
__label__-1	Good luck with that.
__label__1	Hey minorities, you're supposed to be failing, not making America great
__label__1	The Donald hires all the best people.
__label__-1	Hillary Clinton will help you so long as you can afford it
__label__-1	Op is an asshole.
__label__-1	Inb4 censored.
__label__1	Pure coincidence.
__label__1	But it's Hillary's turn!
__label__-1	Johnson has gotten around 16% in some polls of Latinos; use his name!
__label__1	Says who?
__label__-1	More like a little smoke and a lot of mirrors.
__label__1	I love how the Invisible Hand of the Marketplace works so well.
__label__1	Gotta reward a good idea.
__label__1	Because Breitbart = credibility!
__label__1	What a gem of a human being.
__label__-1	By laughing his ass off at Trump ?
__label__-1	Scumbag models receive employment while undocumented, cries about it.
__label__-1	Say what you want about the tenets of any given religion, something like this is just downright insulting.
__label__-1	Slayqueen
__label__1	ELI5: Why do Mexicans dislike Trump?
__label__-1	So, what you're saying is that Jerry Springer was a genius?
__label__1	The cops in Pittsburgh need to wear camouflage to blend in with the foliage that covers the city.
__label__-1	I'm gonna go ahead and side with the fascists on this one.
__label__1	The isolationist Ron Paul wants to have open relations with Cuba!
__label__1	It's just plain awful.
__label__-1	I guess they have now been replaced by atheists.
__label__-1	I support teachers unions, but this is actually a fair point.
__label__-1	"Was it just me, or did anyone else find the author of the article ""pretty unusual?"""
__label__-1	isn't it racist to assume republicans are racist?
__label__-1	"I am looking forward to downvoting all the, ""Well he has a point"" posts that will get made because this is reddit."
__label__-1	I don't know what is worse, the chaos that ensured or the failed talking points they presented at the event
__label__1	The next exhibit in the Nixon library.
__label__-1	Have to wonder if the same logic couldn't be applied to Pot use.
__label__-1	he loves it when the reach out for tomatoes.
__label__1	is everyone overlooking that the statement is technically true..?
__label__-1	"Define ""ghetto."""
__label__1	The lamestream media isn't doing their job, someone has to make sure the story gets out.
__label__-1	I didn't ask for this.
__label__-1	So, how can we impeach Scalia/Thomas?
__label__-1	"I'm 100% convinced that anytime you hear ""republicans say"" followed by words, the complete opposite of what they say is the truth."
__label__1	This is why filming needs to be made illegal.
__label__-1	Tldr philanthropy: ur doing it wong.
__label__-1	I'm gonna punch Jindal in the ear.
__label__1	Because poor flower arrangement is an assault on our sense of vision?
__label__1	If these people are pardoned, we can't win the War on Drugs!
__label__1	My family was so broke my brother and I had to SHARE our new christmas video game console like heathens!
__label__-1	More reasons not to vote for Christie.
__label__1	Raid those funds!
__label__1	Proof that we finally got all them terrorists!
__label__-1	How about a 'merit system' for Republican presidential candidates.
__label__1	So a war on war?
__label__1	It's called The Art of The Deal.
__label__-1	The same reason liberals talk about moving to Canada instead of Mexico if Trump is elected.
__label__1	Outlawing Democrats will.
__label__1	As we all know Hillary Clinton is a key member of the vast right wing conspiracy spreading malicious rumors about Secretary Clinton's health.
__label__-1	Didn't he say a month ago that if he lost PA it was because the election was rigged?
__label__-1	well this is the only way to produce more republicans for the future.. they're dying off one by one.
__label__-1	Another state tries to join the race to the bottom.
__label__1	Because Obama is a Kenyan born muslim that is secretly working for ISIS and China.
__label__1	That's the kind of business skills we need in Washington!
__label__-1	but green partiers told us the supreme court doesn't matter.
__label__1	There's a lot of smoke but no fire
__label__1	Pfft next they'll be asking him to apologize for freedom!
__label__1	I mean didn't they give him a purple heart for his service?
__label__1	I mean, the bullet didn't help him live any longer, so ipso facto, he killed him.
__label__1	Remember though, he endorsed Clinton over Sanders, which obviously means he's a corrupt far-right neoliberal ultra-conservative banister apologist.
__label__1	It's so great seeing a politician of Rudy's calibre sticking up for truth.
__label__-1	He's not a medical professor because such people wouldn't speak ill of Hillary.
__label__1	He sure cares a lot about women's rights for a Muslim.
__label__1	What a clear and un-opinionated piece by a medical professional that concentrated on the medical facts of the situation and not by pandering the same old shit.
__label__1	Shhh, it only counts as a bad thing when the Democrats are running for election.
__label__-1	Surprise Surprise, it's Breibart.
__label__-1	the press is no better than clinton or trump, all of them are imbeciles - clintion- liar, trump -liar, press- self righteous clickbait vultures

__label__1	So eloquent and convincing.
__label__-1	[Trump](https://reddit.com) dodging the draft 5 times means his wimpy orange melon should leave the country.
__label__1	And she will totally follow through with it, not just saying it for the Bernie voters!

__label__-1	She was probably a plant
__label__1	you may get your wish!
__label__-1	Seems to me she is done.
__label__1	Obama must have kicked him another $15k.
__label__-1	Its pretty fucking obvious: Unemployed men: Things suck right now we need change Hillary: I'm going to keep everything the same but help women and minorities more.
__label__1	It could have been $5.6 trillion if it weren't for that tax drain we call NASA
__label__-1	I wish I could upvote this a million times.
__label__-1	Hiding behind her vagina.
__label__1	I'm sure he deserved it for reporting Trumps campaign
__label__-1	Everything out of Trump's mouth clashes with reality.
__label__1	Diplomats are just globalist shills
__label__-1	Why don't I see any mainstream reporting on this yet?
__label__-1	It makes me feel good to look at a picture with a lot of people in it, as that is a meaningful indication of national support.
__label__-1	"""Knock it off"""
__label__1	Just the kind of guy I want to represent me.
__label__1	It's not Breitbart so obviously biased.
__label__-1	This is bigly
__label__1	Thanks Obama!
__label__-1	Uh huh...sure thing Mama Jones, sure thing.
__label__1	Man responsible for knife attacks points out the victims are bleeding.
__label__1	If Mylan company wants to dodge this bullet, they only need to replace their Democratic connected CEO with a Republican connected CEO.
__label__1	I don't understand...why aren't you people pulling yourself up by your bootstraps?
__label__-1	I'm sure he'd find a way to blame Obama for it.
__label__-1	I don't know who paid for that, but thank you.
__label__1	Woah there, you guys don't understand, what he ACTUALLY means is that they will love him because he will make it super easy and cheap for them to switch to renewables.
__label__1	A complete unreasonable request.
__label__1	So counties with the largest income inequalities DON'T have the best economy?
__label__-1	They should have done this during the primary, back when there were still candidates actually worth voting for.
__label__1	...but other than all that, the lying, the lack of knowledge on foreign and domestic affairs, or the lack of basic understanding on what the government actually does...why shouldnt he be president?
__label__1	Yeah, it's a good thing someone finally spoke up
__label__-1	Well, yeah, before you gather evidence there is none.
__label__-1	This is obviously false as Fox News does not have editorial standards.
__label__-1	Which is par for the course in this election.
__label__-1	Let's swap the money that we give to Israel with the money we give to the native Americans.
__label__-1	It ain't even October yet.
__label__1	This is going to go over well for him when he brings up Bills bj.
__label__1	tell me again how Hillary has no ideas or policies and the two candidates are exactly the same
__label__-1	We could handle it by rolling a die and get better results most of the time.
__label__1	But what about the secret hand signals Hillary was throwing out?
__label__1	Doesn't matter, Fox News is now part of the liberal media conspiracy
__label__-1	Who would've thought one day Germany would sell weapons to Israel or Israel would actually buy weapons from Germany?
__label__-1	not that stunning.
__label__1	I don't want any black people on my Republican website!
__label__1	I, for one, am shocked.
__label__-1	Whoops~
__label__-1	It is either complete dishonesty or ignorance for FRAN TOWNSEND to make this argument.... laughable.
__label__1	You act like teachers should have some say in teaching!
__label__-1	But, but..the culture war was lost along time ago.
__label__1	Well thats just being a good Christian.
__label__-1	Yeah... good fucking luck Utah
__label__1	I'm glad to see privatization working.
__label__1	If only everyone carried knives...we would all be safer.
__label__1	Just another form of entitlements if you ask me.
__label__1	Worked so well for Texas, why not try it across the country?
__label__-1	"***""Its over 9000""***"
__label__1	He's not anti-Jewish, just anti-Zionist!
__label__-1	how's that small government, minimal regulation working out for us now?
__label__-1	The Internet is just another forum for public speculation, and the public will always speculate.
__label__-1	I let out a groan when Anne Coulter said that.
__label__1	Time to deregulate oversight.
__label__-1	He doesn't actually say that water should be privatized however.
__label__-1	98.5% of Americans dont live in Louisiana....theres nothing for us to do
__label__1	Yeah, but as long as it isn't Kenya it's perfectly okay.
__label__-1	My home state continues to embarrass me.
__label__1	Well those votes are only worth 3/5ths of a white vote.
__label__1	Right, because anyone who's concerned about our poorly enforced border and immigration laws is obviously just racist and xenophobic.
__label__1	Stay classy Lindsey.
__label__1	Is this the latest GOP minority outreach program?
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__-1	His loyalty is to Israel first.
__label__-1	But can he keep the glasses?
__label__1	How dare you persecute Christians by being against theocracy?
__label__-1	Well he's out of the race... Not that he was in it.
__label__1	They elected Obama twice...
__label__-1	Welcome to 1958.
__label__-1	They keep telling me D0nnie is smart, but that statement is just disgustingly fucking ignorant.
__label__-1	Are we sure Trump isn't a five-year-old?
__label__1	Clearly he's pandering to the felons for their vote
__label__-1	I feel all warm and fuzzy about how pretty much every American, especially Republicans, are full blown email security experts.
__label__1	Oh god there goes his chances
__label__1	Fuck it, lets just make it 100 dollars an hour so we can all be rich.
__label__1	She is essentially a republican
__label__-1	Jesus fucking Christ, I'm embarrassed to live in the same state as this man.
__label__1	Hopefully the anti-vaxxers can unite and send a little cash Trumps way
__label__-1	Didn't they bitch when democrats called Russia over the dnc leaks
__label__-1	What a crook
__label__-1	Lol Trump Train can't be stopped
__label__1	Very Christian of him.
__label__1	But, but Assange promised to destroy Hillary.
__label__1	Well if it's on American Freedom Fighters it must be true!
__label__-1	True Pundit is a joke
__label__1	But it *feels* like she's a felon
__label__-1	And people shouldn't listen to random celebrities for their political opinions.
__label__1	Thanks for clarifying that standard, family values guy.
__label__1	I wish there was some way to prove these statements.
__label__1	Oh, just what we needed!
__label__-1	How do we know that this actually happened?
__label__1	Obama will just pardon them
__label__1	So when is Obama declaring martial law and suspending the election to secure his 3rd term?
__label__-1	Chopped and edited
__label__1	The suit will allege that he didn't give them permission to use his comments or video at his rallies and interviews.
__label__1	Both parties are the same!
__label__1	Oh, well that makes it okay then.
__label__-1	"Just say ""Chia Head."""
__label__-1	Asked for payment up front?
__label__-1	*Leans into mic* **Wrong**
__label__1	He don't need those rapists!
__label__1	It time someone puts those freeloading toddlers to work and show them they can't live sucking on their mother's tit forever!
__label__-1	seriously makes me wonder what would be left after that.
__label__-1	A lot of noted racists, homophobes, and abusers of women on that list.
__label__-1	It's always been a achanging script.
__label__1	Bill Clinton did it first!
__label__1	everybody knows that the more a fringe right wing site resembles a limewire-approved computer virus, the more trustworthy it is!
__label__-1	I want them to show the famous Republican tribal loyalty and be immolated along with their chief.
__label__-1	"Arnold said ""You're Fired"" long before Trump ever did"
__label__1	That is probably only because they are trying to prep him for the Debate.
__label__-1	Mike Pence is a child molester.
__label__1	Because we all know the truth that because Bill is the man and he's the one who's really in charge.
__label__1	That media hivemind everyone
__label__1	And if anyone knows a sociopath when he sees one it is a Wall Street CEO.
__label__1	But we already did when we elected King Obama!
__label__1	Shows he's smart.
__label__-1	[I cannot recall what this comment was before it was removed by a moderator]
__label__1	Yes, canadians flee en masse to accrue massive amounts of debt.
__label__-1	Seriously, when there were musings about the possibility of a private option, the outrage was so huge that the conservatives even came out said they would never do that.
__label__-1	Because he actually committed a crime, and Trump didn't.
__label__-1	Go back to sleep Benzo.
__label__-1	Geez, who doesn't feel persecuted these days?
__label__1	Alaska really has a problem, a President Trump might sell Alaska back to the Russians to cover his personal debts.
__label__1	Wigg?
__label__-1	Because there base has become deranged and doesnt even understand conservatism they just scream about baby killers and crooked hillary.
__label__-1	I'm honestly just proud of them that they know there are more than 2 amendments
__label__-1	Private prisons aren't that bad of an Idea so long as your only throwing the people who deserve to be there in prison.
__label__1	But his outreach to Black voters was so effective.
__label__-1	In before mods delete this.
__label__-1	This is beyond fucking stupid.
__label__-1	Putins going all in for Trump, isn't he?
__label__-1	The only thing dumber than giving money to Donald is expecting that he'd ever give it back to you.
__label__1	Really, I was looking forward to this interview all week
__label__-1	This is one of the most disgusting things I've seen posted on this site.
__label__1	That was brilliant!
__label__-1	WaPo, let me ftfy: The *gate* just opened to charge Chris Christie with a crime on Bridgegate.
__label__-1	Why are people downvoting this?
__label__-1	Lol unless it's a anti trump post people don't believe unconfirmed sources haha.
__label__-1	Why the fuck is 40% of the nation about to vote for the most thin skinned small handed dumbass in this country?
__label__1	"I wish he'd stop pulling at my heart strings, I have such a soft spot for rich, famous, powerful, racist, misogynist, xenophobic ""victims"""
__label__1	What a cuck!
__label__1	That means she won, right?
__label__-1	And they chose Trump for that...?
__label__1	Well what do you expect from a Republican who was deputy Attorney General under Bush?
__label__-1	This breaking news just in - Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.
__label__-1	Because hacking emails is now legal ?
__label__1	He whipped out the Russian thing again.
__label__1	lol what a treat that would be.
__label__1	So, he's not dead, then.
__label__1	oh no.... what a nightmare... The horror of letting the era of Cruz and Mitch McConnell controlling the senate go to Bernie Sanders.
__label__-1	Sooooo a gang?
__label__1	People have been so compassionate and understanding since she came out I can't imagine why she didn't do it sooner!
__label__-1	Booooring, typical discussion on how to campaign against Sanders.
__label__1	This will swing the election.
__label__-1	Nobel laureates dismissing Trump is a badge of honor for the filthy regressive right.
__label__1	Now, there's a defense I'm sure a judge or jury would find persuasive.
__label__1	Now even his campaign staff is rigging the election against him.
__label__-1	I mean this is exactly what the Bernie Bros said about the primary.
__label__-1	They're losing the elections and it'll only get worse.
__label__-1	Fox News is one of the main voices against the idea of climate change, they can't have it on their own debate.
__label__1	She's not taking my toddlers guns, that's for sure.
__label__1	JUST MORE PAWNS IN LIBERAL SCHEME TO STEAL THE ELECTION.
__label__1	I feel like calling him a Nazi is losing it's impact, better start calling him the Anti-Christ next.
__label__-1	I suppose it is, if you mean by getting more votes than her opponent in enough states to win the national vote among delegates/electors.
__label__1	"I'm sure Donald ""Grab 'em by the Pussy"" Trump suing his accusers will go over well with female voters."
__label__1	Oh the poor pitiful things.
__label__-1	We will need a strong Democrat house.
__label__1	But, but Romney proved that having big rallies means you win elections.
__label__-1	Duh.
__label__-1	I'd sooner vote for Hillary Clinton's corpse than Donald Trump.
__label__-1	Wow the one where he threatens Sanders and say he'll send his supporters to Sanders rallies is sketchy as fuck.
__label__1	But the GOP constituency isn't at all racist.
__label__1	They watch themselves, duh.
__label__-1	SHH Clerk, you're supposed to just *imply* you're disenfranchising American citizens from using one of their most basic rights, not say it outright.
__label__-1	nice try, ho chi minh!
__label__-1	Disgusting cretins.
__label__1	Another foreigner trying to influence American elections.
__label__-1	"Title should read ""Donald Trump writes next Clinton campaign ad for them, again."""
__label__1	But he earned that money out of his own pocket unlike crooked Hilary
__label__1	Voter intimidation!
__label__1	Justice Thomas, do you have anything to say about this?
__label__1	I trust Trump will still praise the FBI should it find nothing of significance in the emails.
__label__-1	Upvoted for Nazi-smashing.
__label__1	"I guess there were none of Trump's ""poll watchers"" around to keep things honest."
__label__-1	Ah yes, informal, unscientific opt in online polls are always the best.
__label__1	Oh no, Trumps campaign isn't tinged with racism, it's about ideas!
__label__1	"Democrats sending brown shirts to rallies to instigate violence Dems firebombin a republican headquarters Dems attacking people just for wearing opposition shirt or having a yard sign Dem candidate under FBI investigation DOJ met with former president and spouse of candidate on a plane in secret Said DOJ member now pleads fifth in Iran 1.7 billion to Iran DEms taking millions from foreign govt Dem candidate gets brother on board of company that controls gold mine in Haiti Dem candidate deletes emails, bleach its hard drive, destroys phone with a hammer Dems talk about how they bus voters in Dems armed rebels and plot govt overthrows in ME...but complain that ""Russians"" hacked their email to influence election Yea....Republicans totally worse"
__label__-1	Who is Anthony Weiner?
__label__-1	"Yeah...I've notice the GOP rube never wants a medical ""outsider"" to perform surgery on them."
__label__1	Bu- Bu- Harry Reid said it so it must be true!
__label__1	I got a flat tire because a Russian hacker did it.
__label__-1	Let me be the first to have principles and be rational--congrats to the church for doing the right thing in this case.
__label__1	Yeah I'm sure that they would be happy with a violent black man.
__label__1	Propaganda and advertising have no effect... someone really ought to let all of these companies, politicians and pundits know about this so they stop spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on something that has no effect, since just because it doesn't affect one person, it doesn't affect anyone else.
__label__-1	Greenday came in at #76 and at #78 - with the same song!
__label__-1	And here I thought congress was responsible for budgets
__label__1	Yeah, no way racial profiling by a racist fuck with a gun had anything to do with it!
__label__1	Most likely the work of liberals!
__label__1	It's not like she was doing something innocent like laundering money for drug cartels!
__label__-1	This is what happens when you elect the same politicians over and over who cater to the lobbyists.
__label__1	Obama 2016!
__label__-1	The title alone shows how much you don't understand what your talking about.
__label__-1	Because humans are such peaceful beings right?
__label__1	B-b-b-b-bbut, there's one scientist funded by the Koch brothers who disagrees, so *obviously* more study must be done since the evidence is not conclusive .
__label__1	I'm shocked.
__label__1	BP and Halliburton will counter sue and claim the regulations were too lax and no one inspected them for years.
__label__1	Nothing fishy about this at all.
__label__1	Well this obviously invalidates the entire prolife movement
__label__1	Ya, that McCain, such a liberal, now everyone knows!
__label__-1	vote Dem 2014.
__label__1	The logic, i suppose, being that no one was ever gay in the boy scouts before but now that it is allowed, they suddenly are all gay.
__label__-1	The only people who are surprised by this are dumbfucks who haven't been paying attention for the last fucking 30 fucking years or that think that Reaganomics actually fucking works.
__label__1	Yeah, but what about the dystopian socialist police state that would inevitably follow?
__label__-1	Noetics, modern philosophical school that declares anything you feel is right-is.
__label__1	To be fair, it's relatively easy to have a surplus when Congress isn't approving anything to spend money on.
__label__1	If the EPA would stop protecting the water, and the USDA would stop limiting the catch this pest could be eliminated in a few weeks.
__label__-1	"Somehow, I doubt all those people are ""terrorists."""
__label__1	It is up to the Manatee to stand their own ground and protect their own natural rights.
__label__-1	Yes, because murdering someone is a sever mental illness.
__label__1	Well, you've got to encourage the slackers to make more money, somehow!
__label__-1	267, possession of marijuana, that's a SHOT!
__label__-1	I'd like to see what the 4 guys she married look like,I'm picturing hillbilly's.
__label__-1	If you're going to pander, you may as well pander to them what's got it.
__label__1	Pull that ladder up faster, dude.
__label__1	But it worked so well the last time!
__label__-1	GOP begins to plot strategy to avoid GOP shutdown.
__label__1	Family values candidates ride again.
__label__-1	Unless the event is being held in the kitchen, she really shouldn't be hosting it.
__label__-1	You mean Wal-Mart stores weren't being used to house military weapons to attack and overthrow America with?
__label__1	Oh good, it's been a while since we talked about that
__label__-1	There is a big difference between 5 billion and 5 trillion.
__label__-1	World's dumbest brain surgeon
__label__1	"But she ""cant control"" what her SuperPac does."
__label__1	Obama hasn't been that bad.
__label__1	And the pope doesn't know what he's talking about either.
__label__-1	Bet he was from California.
__label__1	At Quinnipiac University (Connecticut) No bias there.
__label__-1	Cops are scrambling to get those easy possession busts to run up their numbers before they can't ride that gravy train anymore.
__label__-1	And yet, they voted people in who created the laws.
__label__1	"wow it is totally unreasonable to assume that the agency that covered up Bush war crimes because ""muh republican party"" would be partisan as fuck"
__label__-1	Literally ones of people!
__label__-1	There will certainly be more than 1, probably not the 5% she needs though.
__label__-1	Better build a wall around Salt Lake City before the good Mormons get loose.
__label__-1	Can imagine how many high fives he's getting from all the other pieces of shit in texas right now?
__label__1	Makes sense since there's no written record about the existence of gay people prior to the rise of the Soviet Union.
__label__1	When the ballot has a volcano section then we'll talk
__label__-1	Horse-race politics is the new reality tv format by which we elect our leaders.
__label__-1	Looks like Clinton and her staff are at it again
__label__1	Well, if they were white and would vote GOP, this wouldn't be a problem.
__label__-1	What money?
__label__1	Because of fair trade deals and despite their lack of natural resources, no doubt.
__label__1	Well I sure didn't see this endorsement coming.
__label__-1	This is a new low of click bait titles.
__label__1	Tomorrows NYT: FBI claims nothing suspicious found in FBI Twitter activity.
__label__-1	Working as intended.
__label__-1	Can't blame them.
__label__-1	Will those purged votes be added back?
__label__1	But my marriage means absolutely nothing if government doesn't legally say so!
__label__1	No remember that was Russian hackers interfering in our election
__label__-1	What does this say about Dems who can't win without dead and immigrant voters?
__label__-1	Other 20% not polled.
__label__1	Thank god the clintons successfully carried out that hit
__label__1	stop comparing everything to watergate
__label__-1	"It's getting hard to find the daily ""Trump bitching about unfair media"" stories because you have to scroll through like 50 ""Hillary emails"" stories."
__label__-1	"I wonder if he and Melania have an ""understanding""...surely she has to know her husband cheats."
__label__1	You mean they don't?
__label__1	That was quite a contribution to American Society, too.
__label__1	Yeah, because his Native American family will do so much better with Trump as President.
__label__1	I wonder who they're voting for.
__label__1	Science Schmience
__label__-1	Why is it worded as though the election has already been decided?
__label__1	I'm sure Hillary will pardon him now instead of trying to kill him
__label__1	You wouldn't have to do that often if you had a billion or two like ole' Donald.
__label__1	Therefore Trump is automatically president!
__label__-1	GOP: Grab Our Privates.
__label__-1	"I'm so excited for Trump to claim that the election was indeed rigged because ""They found dozens of examples of fraudulent voting,"" only to be reminded that they all supported him."
__label__-1	Better luck next time.
__label__-1	To be fair, you know it's dangerous but a part of you wants to see Stevie behind the wheel
__label__1	Cause why not go out with some class?
__label__-1	Hope those college students view him out.
__label__1	She was voting her conscience
__label__-1	who'd she vote for?
__label__-1	Pretty sure she wrote in Biff Tannon
__label__1	So...what you're telling me is that white people are impatient?
__label__1	Oh, I'm sure there be no trouble from a Trump White House.
__label__1	Yeah, we could all really come together if a party won the presidency with 12% of the vote!
__label__1	Glad black people have an ally in progressives
__label__1	Yeah because clinton wasn't a household name
__label__-1	what is wrong with bringing the bathroom situation to a local level?
__label__1	Well once they outlaw internet porn, those speeds won't be as important.
__label__-1	That was not acceptable despite your implication.
__label__-1	When Hillary actually got more votes than trump
__label__-1	Just have to laugh at comments like this.
__label__-1	Let's face it, most high school kids are assholes.
__label__-1	Common dreams once again proves they are more fake liberal than the Democratic Party they attack.
__label__1	Damn you Russia!
__label__-1	Make sure you wash that brush off when you're done with those broad strokes.
__label__-1	I'd wager that if put up for a referendum in California, Oregon, and Washington, each state would vote to stay into the union.
__label__-1	The only hatemongering and fear and racism in this country right now is coming from the people who supported Hillary Clinton.
__label__1	Maybe it's a hoax.
__label__1	If she has him adopted her next child could be a democrat.
__label__1	Well, at least he's draining his own swamp
__label__-1	Does she have any actual experience in the Pentagon?
__label__1	Oh, sure, *now* he starts lying.
__label__-1	eeweeie
__label__1	Clearly he's just upset at the loss of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt.
__label__-1	Director of Internal Newsletters, tops.
__label__1	Legacy.
__label__1	Man, how is Wikileaks not *all over* this?
__label__-1	So salty.
__label__1	Not another email scandal.
__label__-1	They're already working on winning him the second term, apparently
__label__-1	I'm sure Comey will get right on it.
__label__1	Because we spent so much time at the debates and on the campaign trail discussing climate.
__label__1	A good thing he's about transparency!
__label__-1	You do realise that with 62 million votes, around 20% of the US voted for Hilary.
__label__1	yeah, fuck the receptionist and HR personnel.
__label__1	They can go to another state.
__label__1	And let's not forget that other great precedent from one of Donald Trump's heroes who had jews wear stars of David on their clothing.
__label__1	Well that solves it Megyn Kelly is clearly a liberal shill!
__label__1	Apparently it pays pretty well to be a protester.
__label__1	Yay!
__label__1	I can see why the religious right really like him.
__label__-1	Warren should have endorsed Bernie Sanders
__label__-1	This guy could've been president lol you snooze you lose we America now beetches
__label__-1	Fuck you why dont you move to another country asshole
__label__-1	Good people don't smoke they drink scotch and beat their wives.
__label__1	Doesn't matter, it is Trump's fault
__label__-1	The majority of American voters picked Hillary to be president.
__label__-1	They are just creating new jobs!
__label__-1	Has a single woman's name besides Nikki Haley even been put out as being considered for any cabinet position?
__label__1	It sure worked out well, didn't it?
__label__1	No conflict of interest here
__label__-1	Hear, hear
__label__-1	cut out the middle man
__label__1	Oh yes, let's look to the slave owning, genocidal, classist, and wealthy founding fathers to save us from Trump.
__label__1	"It's ok because Trump will get rid of political correctness and ""urban"" people will be put in their place."
__label__1	why not make tax optional too?
__label__-1	survey, you mean some useless poll.
__label__-1	Crooked Donald
__label__1	This will end well
__label__1	It's almost as if multiple people are posting their own thoughts!
__label__1	But but...I was told this couldn't happen all along
__label__-1	Authoritarian proposes authoritarian policy, news at 11.
__label__-1	Don't we already have that?
__label__-1	Let me guess she's a racist too?
__label__1	THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
__label__1	He wasn't vetted and it worked out just fine...
__label__-1	I am going to express my outrage over this by commenting here.
__label__-1	It would take longer than 4 years to sell all his shit
__label__-1	I won Ms America if you ignore the contest, the voting, and me being a guy.
__label__1	I for one believe Trump and want to recount every single vote so that he can take credit for the popular vote and be vindicated in his claim.
__label__1	Watch out Donnie, the Hillary Dream Team is coming to get you!
__label__1	This woman is now qualified for - sec of commerce (she is a good negotiator) - sec of state (she is tough and Yep loyalist) - health ministry (because she can lead by example) - consultant at Breitbart (because they are not misogynistic)
__label__-1	*That we know of
__label__-1	"Trump: ""The election is rigged"" Liberals: ""LOL LE DRUMPF IS SO STUPID"" *Trump wins* Liberals: ""OMG THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED"""
__label__-1	Because we young ppl woke
__label__1	I thought obama and Hillary created it?
__label__-1	I guess the swamp needed it's Yoda back.
__label__1	Yeah let California and New York decide every presidency.
__label__1	2.3 million illegal votes!
__label__-1	No
__label__-1	Nice selective inclusion of dates to exaggerate your point, which isn't really a point, it's just juvenile politics as usual.
__label__1	All of the nice, loving, progressive people want him dead because he is such a hater.
__label__-1	Voted up.
__label__1	I see the Paul voting brigade is out in force today
__label__-1	Time to trim the fat with the leeches claiming EITC too.
__label__1	I'm shocked I tell you!
__label__-1	For people who hate abortions, they seem to want to cause more with stupidity such as this.
__label__-1	Stay classy, San Diego.
__label__1	All of you are conspiratards
__label__-1	It is true, they are using data mining to detect patterns in call history.
__label__1	As we all know, guns only = murdering children in schools.
__label__1	It's almost like the war on terror is just an excuse to remove our freedoms.
__label__-1	because, as we all know, English is the official language of the USA.
__label__1	I'm sure he knows what is best.
__label__-1	Lots of lip service to outreach, followed by doubling down on aggressive social legislation that offends women, Latinos, gays, and lower incomes.
__label__-1	And no matter what we say, Republicans in the House won't let the House vote on the presidents job proposals.
__label__1	Remember: there is no difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.
__label__-1	You have to believe him... he wears glasses now.
__label__1	Kids today have it too easy though
__label__-1	Is this for medical or just general legalization?
__label__1	Do I smell a new Scandal?
__label__1	Nah, we just have to fund more tax-cuts for the corporations and trickling will save the economy
__label__1	Now Vermont will turn into an immoral pit of chaos, just you wait.
__label__1	Letterman is a loser!
__label__-1	Some people in this country can not responsibly exercise the right to bear arms.
__label__1	Well, people on reddit say he doesn't have a chance so I don't see why he doesn't just give up.
__label__1	Maybe Congress should form a committee to look into this
__label__1	Geez, I would have thought Barry would have been long ago impeached.
__label__1	From the people who resorted to their own polling when they didn't like what they were seeing last go round...yeah, sure, right.
__label__-1	Unless we go by Twitter supporters, in which case Trump won.
__label__-1	bourgeois idealism
__label__-1	LOL, that's fine because Bernie's going to be president.
__label__1	Fact Checking is liberal conspiracy!
__label__1	Nice lead-ins to a very substantive questions, Roskam.
__label__-1	He's probably advocating a voucher system so everyone gets the money to go to whatever school they want.
__label__-1	Sounds about right
__label__-1	damn people are responding to this, huh
__label__-1	"Waiting for right wing to radio decry the ""Mexican liberal media""?"
__label__1	Perhaps... It's a good thing that we have now stopped aging in it's tracks.
__label__-1	Rubio is a redneck
__label__-1	Capital One - Who's in YOUR wallet?

__label__1	Sure its high, but how high would it be if we didn't' count illegals and California?
__label__1	It just makes sense that my vote is worth less than the vote of someone in a different state, right?
__label__-1	It is almost like something that is completely necessary to decide about the ethics of a candidate.
__label__-1	"maybe those people should start working, earning, and paying for the nice things they want in life (it works for me), instead of asking the ""evil rich people"" to change their diapers for them."

__label__1	FDR hid that he used a wheelchair.
__label__-1	His bank accounts say he is poorer than he claims as well.
__label__-1	That's kind of a fucked up thing to do
__label__1	Should have just droned him.

__label__-1	Is this something that would be contested in the judicial branch?
__label__-1	I hate Trump but this is dumb.
__label__1	So, he is dealing with our major enemies first.
__label__-1	Who dat
__label__1	They're just Nobel laureates, they don't compare to the integrity of a failed businessman who works with literal Nazis

__label__-1	Daily Caller is a poor man's Breitbart.. so what does that tell you of it's quality.
__label__1	good thing trump cant be bribed.. his admin might be full of donors with special interests instead of experts.
__label__-1	Where are the The_Dumbass supporters that were adamant that their candidate was pro-marijuana?
__label__1	Yes, it's better to make pot illegal and send that money over the border to the cartels.
__label__1	These people think it's time to party....I guess they can't read.
__label__-1	Another colossal waste of resources.
__label__-1	I regret that I have but one downvote to give to Neocon Revisionism Online.
__label__1	at least he started wearing a big-boy tie
__label__1	Can't stop winning
__label__-1	DHS may have strapped its balls on.
__label__1	All I want to know....with all this cutting....have my taxes gone down yet?
__label__1	Reince Priebus...lie?
__label__1	Probably just leftover hate from the Obama administration
__label__1	Now activists just need trump supporters to support replacing obamacare with the ACA.
__label__-1	Good.
__label__-1	How do you justify to your foreign friends the American people electing Trump?
__label__1	Were these the same polls that predicted Hillary winning by five billion votes?
__label__1	No less an endorsement or political statement by visiting dignitaries obliged to stay at any one of his hotels.
__label__-1	As told by the lying sack of shit reince priebus.
__label__1	Someone really gullible and accountable to no one, preferably.
__label__1	oh for the love of god...ok yeah screw the children!
__label__1	It shows his strength.

__label__-1	Well didn't Trump see thousands of Jews celebrating on rooftops in New Jersey?
__label__-1	Business owners who knowingly hire illegal undocumented immigrants should face jail time.

__label__-1	I wish the Federal Elections Commission or Courts actually did something about this abuse of our elections.
__label__1	fuck that columbus day is way more relevant and important!

__label__1	That will show their competence in governance.
__label__1	And is anyone going to jail?
__label__-1	This is literally, and I don't mean that figuratively, the stupidest comparison I have ever heard.
__label__-1	Well duh, that is one big part of the plan, expand Medicaid to cover more of the poor, for example single men were once forbidden health care via Medicaid, retirees, children and the mothers.
__label__-1	If it weren't so sad it would be funny.

__label__-1	Dripping with that good ol GOP racism.
__label__-1	They're still extremely vulnerable after they're born, but that's when the GOP stops caring about them.
__label__1	So, up to now it's been positive?
__label__1	Who would want to sell their guns when Obama's coming to take them all away?
__label__-1	Gee I wonder if they are red or blue states?
__label__1	"""wants to help working families"" Well, then no party better than the Republicans which have passed so many great pieces of legislation that's helped working families over the last 3 decades."

__label__1	It's fine, we can just drink all them libruhl tears.
__label__1	Lock him up!
__label__1	He's such a relatable president, a real man of the people!
__label__-1	Who needs daily intelligence briefings when you have Fox News?
__label__1	The murderers were probably Muslims
__label__1	But Bill Clinton is a Sodomite, so in Gods' eyes, that's different!
__label__1	Be more obvious about it.
__label__1	It's no big deal he told a white lie Now if a black tells a lie, that would serious &amp;nbsp;
__label__1	Well how are we going to win the upcoming wars with Iran, China, and North Korea if we're still paying for useless shit like PBS and the National Endowment for the Arts!
__label__1	My god, it could be as bad as a tea ceremony!
__label__1	I'm sure liberals will embrace his form of conservatism.
__label__-1	So essentially he is angry at everyone?
__label__-1	Among many more scandalous and potentially criminal things, President Trump will go down in history as a textbook example of early 21st century social media addiction.
__label__1	Keep electing old white guys into office, they're clearly not the problem.
__label__1	Sweden's rape statistics tho.
__label__1	Locker room talk
__label__1	Don't worry, he'll pivot to the center any time now.
__label__-1	That was in a different timeline.
__label__1	Clearly it needs to be repealed then.
__label__-1	I'm not sure if people wouldn't appreciate some leverage over the russia investigation in the end.
__label__-1	The longer we allow Russian spies to occupy the White House, the worse the infiltration will be.
__label__-1	They were all dupes anyway, and some of them still haven't figured it out and defend Trump.
__label__1	Sure, because *that's* what was wrong with health care.
__label__1	Soros was in a generous mood.
__label__-1	Trump supporters are violent and sick people.
__label__1	The onion, is that you?
__label__-1	Forgot to ask me again, polls
__label__-1	The number of people cheating on food stamps and the amount of money lost is orders of magnitude smaller than the amount lost to businesses cheating on taxes.
__label__1	The blame game is always a good game to play.
__label__1	George Soros has been busy.
__label__1	No more press events but please may we have more rallies.
__label__1	Luckily, Chaffetz said the Flynn situation has resolved itself and no further investigation is required by the House Oversight Committee.
__label__1	Remember folks, class warfare doesn't exist unless it's against the rich!
__label__1	Man it's like they didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition
__label__1	Wow, this is such a credible source of news.
__label__-1	People who think like this are afraid of their own shadow
__label__1	Any new coal mining or dead industry jobs in there Donald?
__label__1	Obama is collaborating with the GLOBALIST Jews to poison our water and make our frickin frogs gay

__label__-1	Poe's law.
__label__1	It's just that crazy lying press again, making up fake news about Trump tweets that certainly never happened.
__label__-1	Trump came right out and said he supported killing terrorists families, and was elected anyways.
__label__-1	Hey now, let's not call people names.
__label__1	Won't somebody please think of the property that was damaged?
__label__1	Well if Putin aides say it, it must be true!
__label__1	They'll just have to give up their iPhones
__label__-1	This seems like a very flimsy avenue to try to go down down.
__label__1	Relax, I'm sure White Bible thumpin' Christians will step up and foster all the kids in need.
__label__-1	Jeff Sessions nods
__label__1	he probably gives them gift certificates to his properties that aren't enough to actually buy anything so they still have to spend money on his shit just to utilize the gift.
__label__1	dae liberals are equally as anti-science as conservatives because they're anti-vaxxers?
__label__1	Stupid democrats, how dare their actions match their words!
__label__1	Those Seniors should just borrow money from their parents
__label__-1	"""...but wont let go of Putin's crank."""
__label__-1	...unknown at this time.
__label__-1	Let them eat bootstraps!
__label__1	You are all just SJWs, Hitler was just misunderstood.
__label__-1	We are watching you not listening to you, since at this point you have proven to have the worst words.
__label__-1	He's gonna lead us to a BS war to boost his popularity isn't he
__label__-1	"Get it to ""404"" votes... president not found!"
__label__1	Throwing a spanner in the works of one of the most powerful intelligence allegiances on the globe - nope, nothing to see here
__label__1	The White House Counsel said it was fine, I don't see the big deal.
__label__1	Ethics are for poor people.
__label__-1	But they didn't tap trumps phone.
__label__-1	If the rest of Trump's presidency played out the same as William Henry Harrison's, I would view that as an improvement.
__label__-1	"Hmmm... the phrase ""welfare queen"" seems to fit really well here"
__label__-1	Well, at least that's one less promise to America he chose to break.
__label__-1	How is this germane to any of the topics of the day?
__label__1	Wow I am so shocked by this
__label__1	Hah, the failing Fortune magazine joins the ranks of fake news, such a sad display of diverse undeserving losers, Trump is glad not be on this sad sad list.
__label__1	I vote for Trump and republicans because I may not have much, but hell they make sure other has less!
__label__-1	Of this entire scandal, Nunez has the absolute worst poker face.
__label__1	That is because 69% of Californians are illegal immigrants.
__label__-1	It's certainly been debunked pretty consistently.
__label__-1	It was his plan to threaten Republicans to pass a bill that tanked his approval ratings so he could, uh, we haven't gotten that far yet.
__label__-1	Stupid orange fucker faces a backlash for getting up in the morning.
__label__-1	"""We have never heard of Paul Granafort..."""
__label__1	Trumperican is the new American, or else.
__label__1	come on - remember all the money he raised for charity being waterboarded?
__label__1	But hey, those emails, Benghazi and those Obama golf outings are *SO* much more important, amirite?
__label__-1	*Obligatory blowjob joke*
__label__1	Well yeah, cuz they're bortin' all tha babees.
__label__1	Small price to pay for keeping their women and female children safe
__label__-1	Hey, corporations are people and now they will have the freedom to sell data they compiled!
__label__-1	why else would he or any of them be doing it
__label__1	Wouldn't it be cheaper to just make Mexico a state (or several)?
__label__-1	he's a better Trump then Trump.
__label__1	I'm sure he'll get right on that.
__label__1	Yeah, Chaffetz will get right on that.
__label__1	Fox News: Focusing on the real news
__label__1	Don't you know, this is totally normal for a President to have
__label__-1	Does Ryan need a second Trumpcare fiasco to teach him a lesson?
__label__1	But^guys^it^was^4chan
__label__1	But both sides are exactly the same.
__label__-1	The party of personal freedom* *unless you are brown, poor, not a Christian, have a vagina, not a Republican
__label__-1	Only if the space ships run on coal.
__label__1	But according the Chafetz, they are rich so they cant possibly be corrupt, make policies that benefit their business, consider quid pro quo or do pay for play.
__label__-1	Oooh baby you caught me red handed Creepin' on the senate floor Picture this we were makin' up candidates Being huge election whores
__label__-1	Welcome to china
__label__-1	What's the Vegas Line on this one?
__label__-1	"to quote william gibson: ""she stared directly into those soft blue eyes and knew, with an instinctive mammalian certainty, that the exceedingly rich were no longer even remotely human. """
__label__-1	I wonder why it isn't thought men should have access to free contraception.
__label__1	It's OK guys it'll make Romney richer.
__label__-1	That is a blatant violation of the law on so many levels.
__label__-1	"You sure that wasn't ""boy""?"
__label__-1	Bootstraps of course.
__label__-1	Sounds like Tuesday night at the Apollo.
__label__-1	Yeah, but how do they taste?
__label__1	I bet they'll use roads to get there, too!...Pfft, hypocrites!
__label__1	This is clearly fake, Republicans don't use teleprompters
__label__-1	This may have already between said, but who the fuck are the 22% who didn't mind/were in favor of a government shut down?
__label__1	It's ok because they only kept the metadata!
__label__1	It's a pipeline rupture most likely he will lose his farm for having stolen all that oil from the oil companies!
__label__-1	I think it would be hilarious if the GOP unveiled a single payer system as their counter the ACA.
__label__-1	It's not a War on Drugs, it's a War on Personal Freedom funded by people who are not longer free against themselves.
__label__1	Yeah because govt is soooo responsible with our tax money.
__label__1	I bet Obama is going to call for socialized police now.
__label__1	baby steps, baby steps
__label__-1	It boils down to the following question: Can and should a democratic society afford a powerful blackbox that is beyond the control of the public?
__label__-1	Maybe this would lead to DC statehood becoming an issue again.
__label__1	My state has tons of oil, therefore climate change CAN'T be real.
__label__-1	The campaign promise will be broken when she decides to run for president
__label__1	I am very happy that those republicans are reducing my rights, freeing me to do more work for our 1% masters!
__label__1	"So if a professor at a college receiving federal funds said ""I hate Democrats for being intolerant of opposing viewpoints and polarizing racial groups against each other"" I'm sure that would be all good."
__label__1	Can't say they're not exciting
__label__1	Because this one wears glasses
__label__-1	We're also not going to be a country that tolerates torturers.
__label__-1	In other news, the pope is catholic
__label__-1	Criminal recommends no charges for his crime.
__label__1	It's obviously due to the GOP taking over the Senate.... Since that happened, everyone wants to buy more.
__label__1	Liberals are the real racists
__label__-1	Say racists...yeah, being black and commenting on civil unrest is a sure plop into hot waters....the MEDIA is the root of this evil.
__label__1	Trying to take their house was a perfectly proportional response.
__label__1	Followed by laws that repeal Obamacare ad infinitum, hooray!
__label__1	Wow I'm so going to vote for sanders instead of trump now !
__label__1	Gosh darn those pesky gotcha questions!
__label__-1	Lol
__label__-1	Cue video of Hillary talking about how they were poor people when they left the white house.
__label__-1	Title had me all excited, then the article had no actual data in it.
__label__-1	We The People can do that for him.
__label__-1	i love sanders but it seems like there just trying to get them to agree with ideology they just don't match up with
__label__-1	He would have made more but it's hard to get paid when your core audience has no money, and expects to get free shit.
__label__-1	It's not about staff She hired almost entire Obama team to re-run her failed 2008 campaign.
__label__1	Because you need to go pick a new outfit, that one is hideous
__label__-1	Of course this is thumbed down all the way to the bottom.
__label__-1	He makes some interesting observations about how Libya was Hillary's Iraq.
__label__-1	Typical scumbag Clinton tactics.
__label__-1	Did a story like this break in '08 or '12?
__label__1	but she has the super delegates
__label__-1	Thank you, Captain.
__label__-1	It was glorious.
__label__-1	And I bet 90% of Bernie supporters wish the USSR won the Cold War
__label__-1	don't trust FOX polls
__label__1	Oh yay, another free beacon push poll... How credible.
__label__-1	Winning the Ron Paul 2012 crowd
__label__-1	Disagree, but I still think he's a helluva actor.
__label__1	Everyone in Nevada must be an establishment shill then.
__label__1	Of course, black people should vote on who the englad white guy choses.
__label__-1	Jesus was a socialist Jew.
__label__1	Typical CEO of some random company endorses the establishment candidate
__label__1	Oh youbetcha Joe, youbetcha!
__label__-1	When you add two turds together, you still end up with a turd.
__label__-1	Less childish I imagine
__label__1	Yeah, let's ask other countries to pay for our shit.
__label__-1	Republicans hate the poor
__label__-1	Clearly rolling on molly, getting ready to go to a country EDM rave later.
__label__1	Just wait until after the debates.
__label__1	I'm sure this spot-on analysis will win you many Black voters.
__label__1	But...but....he's basically progun!
__label__-1	Fuck all this.. if it comes down to it I'm going Trump over Clinton
__label__-1	Political news.
__label__-1	How many times do we need to see this video?
__label__1	Thanks Trump!
__label__-1	Slurring and wandering about the guy seemed drunk.
__label__-1	I can smell the impeachment papers being printed.
__label__-1	The race between impeachment and war.
__label__-1	Circa news is garbage.
__label__1	Good thing it was just a non-legally binding pledge and not something serious.
__label__-1	Fake news
__label__1	Double negatives means she *admits* to being the source of the leaks!
__label__1	money is speech
__label__1	All about the little guy, that billionaire is.
__label__-1	Gradually going to drain the swamp of the creatures they filled it with themselves.
__label__1	But that Bill Clinton... wooo boy.
__label__-1	"One of his supporters said ""when you're a star you can do anything."""
__label__-1	What in the actual fuck is going on with our government.
__label__-1	yeah but they had more than two pages and didn't have any illustrations, so that's unfair to Trump
__label__-1	Or jail if discovered after the fact.
__label__1	Gosh, and he was on pace to create 25 billion jobs.
__label__1	Thanks, Kentucky.
__label__-1	Before you judge a man, you must drink a gallon with his liver.
__label__1	Finally, something to justify my paying for VPN!
__label__-1	That's great and all, but we should probably focus on protecting something that we have and the Republicans are actively trying to destroy instead of Medicaid-For-All which has no chance of passing in this Congress.
__label__-1	Fuck him.
__label__1	Because if someone is badass enough to get past all his secret security, they'd certainly stand no chance against Donald the Great, right?
__label__-1	Alternative Air.
__label__-1	"Nah, Hitler just showed troubled Jewish youth Zyklon-B movies at all those ""Holocaust Centers""."
__label__1	Must be the effect of Global warming in Moscow.
__label__-1	Americans are ridiculously overworked.
__label__1	I am sure that this will end well.
__label__-1	Thats a bold negotiating move Cotton, lets see how that works out.
__label__-1	"""pls can i be relevant again"" edition 968548475984"
__label__-1	So the continuation of the Obama budget and policies?
__label__-1	That is the expected response of a dictator who uses chemical weapons on children.
__label__1	Well, at least this won't enrage generations of terrorists for years to come
__label__1	He should really have the raw fish, I hear it's great at Mar-A-Lago
__label__-1	t_d brigade is in full damage control, boys
__label__-1	well at least someone in the corporate media is trying to pay attention, but is this getting top billing on MSNBC itself or are they burying it?
__label__1	Gotta love the smell of burning Humans.
__label__1	Oh cool Mike will sort this all out
__label__-1	Right wingers are originalists except when it comes to the separation of church and state.
__label__-1	Lobbying should be illegal, it's legal bribery.
__label__-1	Basically everyone in the rest of the civilized world do, because facts, reality and history has proven that it is the best model (even though they implement it in different ways).
__label__1	Incredible coincidence!
__label__1	Didn't he created that 350k jobs first quarter?
__label__-1	One of the top ten reasons he is completely illegitimate.
__label__1	I can't believe that Seattle treats people like actual humans instead of the cockroaches they are for being born on the other side of an imaginary line!
__label__1	I'd never thought of Pence as a jingoist.
__label__-1	To Trump supporters, go luck with that.
__label__1	Thanks Trump!
__label__1	OMG, maybe the 4chan theory about Trump being a time traveler was right all along!
__label__-1	"The title is misleading, he just said ""great friend of mine"", which could also be intrepreted as ""he was a great friend of mine""."
__label__-1	Since I'm full on tinfoil over the trump Russia connection to me this looks like exxon(Rex tillerson) asking this just so it could be shot down to give the illusion this administration isn't in bed with the Russians.
__label__-1	Epic photo of trolls.
__label__-1	He has a centuries old superiority complex.
__label__-1	Get your anti-science rhetoric out of here.
__label__-1	So, will they become like wildlings?
__label__-1	The look on the soldier's face says a lot.
__label__1	Finally a decent explanation of why he vacations and golfs so much.
__label__-1	Darth Bannon got ditched for Palpatine.
__label__-1	They know COMPLICIT when they see it.
__label__-1	That's because New Yorkers have had to deal with the shithead for years.
__label__-1	Obama: The buck stops with me Trump: Not my responsibility GOP: lol personal responsibility
__label__1	Can't wait.
__label__-1	So basically, with our gerrymandered districts, Trump would still win?
__label__-1	"This is for ""Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"" so I expect a lot talk about leaks."
__label__1	No no people this vacation has been in the works for a long time!
__label__-1	Pathetic fucking fat slob.
__label__-1	So have your grabber already.
__label__1	I'm amazed no one saw this coming.
__label__-1	Manafort looks like he's always eyeing how far it is to the nearest exit.
__label__1	Well, his default position is that America is getting boned by anybody and everybody, so they should have prepared a contingency, obviously
__label__1	Clearly the vouchers weren't big enough.
__label__1	That 20% unemployment rate really upset people
__label__-1	Of course he did
__label__-1	Workers of the World Unite!
__label__-1	i like they are called blacks
__label__1	I'm sure if she told Obama to go back to Kenya instead of telling us Jews to go back to Poland she wouldn't be where she is today
__label__1	OMG SHE MADE A RETURN ON HER INVESTMENT WHAT A WHORE!
__label__-1	*martial Not that I know much about Norwegian politics or subversive views thereof, but if you hope to be taken remotely seriously, you might want to state what would make you think that.
__label__-1	Expected.
__label__1	Good to see that Republicans are so law and order type people.
__label__1	I'm shocked...SHOCKED!
__label__1	Privatizing our prison will fix EVERYTHING and get GOVERNMENT OUT!
__label__1	Cant they just borrow money from their parents to get a better education?
__label__-1	Popcorn please!
__label__1	Well, finally he is getting into the specifics of the policies he'll implement as president!
__label__-1	What a professional guy.....if he just simply dropped out of the race like he should've then Sarvis would've won and Virginia would be in a much better position.
__label__-1	No no he said sorry so it's all good
__label__-1	They're wealthy overlords, treating poors like shit is the only way they know.
__label__1	i have panic attacks without weed sometimes, should i be scheduled?
__label__1	"More evidence of the ""War on Christianity."""
__label__-1	Except Republicans fought the civil war to abolish slavery, but yeah screw them.
__label__1	If Obama is Hitler, maybe Weber should be an Auschwitz Jew
__label__1	Oh, that the comedy gods smile upon us and grant us such a candidate as Ted Cruz.
__label__-1	And globally, it's not just an American problem anymore, Corporations are above mere national identities and are becoming extranational (I think that's a word) they don't have any allegiance, they don't have any sort of patriotism, the fight for maximum profits is now fully international, money is being sucked out of every family, every pocket, every government, and funnelling into that 1%

__label__-1	The people are choosing their champion over a paid witch.
__label__1	Lets trust her with the government.
__label__-1	Trump is probably the least damaging of the GOP lineup.
__label__1	I'm still on the fence until Tony Basil makes her endorsement.
__label__1	"In the most southern accent you can imagine - ""The south shall rise again!!"""
__label__-1	A minor setback.
__label__1	"lol, yeah after their last ""operation"" against him did sooooooo much damage"

__label__1	We have sanctuary cities to keep tabs on them.
__label__-1	Cool story bro
__label__1	that's Trumps fault for being literally Hitler
__label__1	It's all Trump's fault, because his racist, fascist, xenophobic speech *triggered* people to start protesting and blocking traffic!
__label__-1	On what planet?
__label__1	Clearly this article from CNN is the right wing's attempt to smear the Clintons!
__label__-1	Because of course.
__label__1	Nothing stops radicalization like the sense that your government is targeting you based on your religion.
__label__-1	~~Captain Renault~~ Speaker Ryan: I'm shocked, *shocked* to find that ~~gambling~~ distrust of government is going on in here!
__label__1	This a new criticism of Trump, I haven't heard him called a racist yet.
__label__1	And slaves were only whipped because they deserved it.
__label__1	"He's a cranky old Jew; this is as ""nice"" as he gets!"
__label__1	But that was wiped.
__label__1	By calling their supporters stupid white trash and racist women-hating biggots
__label__1	"Hillary's going to tell big pharma to ""stop it"" then we'll have a discussion, problem solved"

__label__1	You think Mitt Romney would do something against the rules?
__label__-1	One of my friends bought a '92 Integra earlier this year...he was lucky enough to ditch it before it died.
__label__-1	Crazy is as stupid does.
__label__1	Because I care what foreigners think about our politics.
__label__1	...and your point is?
__label__-1	From reading the headline, science is pointing to a sky daddy causing the superstorms.
__label__1	Oh, well, then I guess we can forget about all his constant lying and flip flopping and elect him president, because the only requirement for POTUS is that you gave a lot to charity!
__label__1	Netanyahu is such a great person I'm sure he will have no problem winning over world leaders.
__label__1	"They meant to say ""the little woman""."
__label__-1	Reports indicate they found credible evidence of your mother's deviant sexual proclivities.
__label__1	But Mother Jones is a respected, fair, neutral news source that always avoids sensationalism and strives to report only the facts!

__label__1	Well I hope Scott can deal with those terrorists.
__label__1	But the unemployment rate is really low, so there's nothing to worry about :-)
__label__-1	as long as it prevents the votes of the opposing party im fine with it :)
__label__1	Yeah state government should be the ones to restrict your freedom instead of the federal government
__label__-1	Why do you have to be racist about it?
__label__-1	What a pathetic, completely transparent publicity stunt.
__label__-1	You have no right to question her, all other scumbag politicians have done the same as her and nobody questioned them.
__label__1	I'm sure this will play great in NY
__label__-1	Not Stark Tech?
__label__-1	maybe she's taking money from the lobbies from other planets as well
__label__1	Has an oil leak ever turned out to be better than originally thought
__label__-1	Anyone have tips for how to wipe the splooge off from inside my monitor?
__label__-1	Scalia wanted more Diversity on the court too In the form of Justices from 'flyover' states and justices not from Harvard or Yale
__label__1	Boy Obama, really letting your sexist flag fly, huh?
__label__-1	I hear that comes with a President Ron Paul commemorative plaque.
__label__-1	"Truly ""establishment"" has become the buzzword for this election."

__label__-1	Source for that please?
__label__1	What a great rallying cry
__label__-1	Do you post this exact comment on every anti-Hillary article?
__label__1	New York is just another Deep South state.

__label__-1	Louisianan here... didn't vote lol
__label__-1	And yet she still is going to win the presidency!
__label__1	Paul Krugman doesn't like Bernie Sanders.. Breaking news.
__label__-1	No, if it's not Hillary, then there's no reason to not give it to Bernie.
__label__1	But they bleed from their where-evers!
__label__-1	I hope the police treat him the way he treated them when he sitting in rikers.
__label__-1	That guy is an asshat
__label__1	Those lazy bastards need to get them a nonexistent job that I didn't create with all tax cuts I gave to the corporations and the rich.
__label__1	But I'm poor and I vote, so doesn't that mean all poor people also vote?
__label__-1	That's what reddit is for!
__label__1	Someone has got to get these HillaryBros under control
__label__1	Doesn't count it is a deep south state.
__label__-1	Unless he is going to admit that he is actually the Zodiac Killer I don't think anyone cares what be announces at this point.
__label__1	You have to wonder if Congress will continue to employ the Hastert Rule, or at the very least change what it means.
__label__-1	Foreign policy experience!
__label__1	Yeah, those peaceful Trump supporters sure were asking for it
__label__-1	That this excludes correct the record, a superPAC that openly coordinated with the Clinton campaign is disturbing and misleading.
__label__-1	And articles like this are why clicking on sputniknews are a waste of your time.
__label__1	Sure, that's fine because that keeps the sanctity of marriage secure.
__label__1	Its great to know that such a highly regarded economist spoke grammatically correctly.
__label__1	Wearing that kind of racism on her sleeve, she must be a teabagger!
__label__-1	Goddamn it Obama *Never* go FULL Republican
__label__-1	Defense contractors don't think it was a waste.
__label__1	Those pesky poor have had it too good for too long.
__label__1	How else do you conduct a cover up?
__label__1	That's some good old fiscal responsibility.
__label__-1	"If you get a ""choose life"" plate and aren't pro-choice, you're a manifest hypocrite and don't even know it."
__label__-1	Ah, this is the same Herman Cain that wants to slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 9%.
__label__-1	Heck, I'd give money to the only republican that isn't full of shit.
__label__-1	They should be spending this money to secure abortion clinics or black churches, either of which have suffered more terrorist attacks than synagogues.
__label__1	It's cool, it's not like he's pledged to lay down his life for them if the situation calls for it.
__label__-1	Isn't that some beautiful irony.
__label__1	She was probably hired by the democrats to make republicans look bad.
__label__-1	Don't be jealous - You are welcome to come over and gawp at her houses and jewelry any time you like (and of course we don't need an election, because we all luv 'er gaud bless 'er)
__label__-1	That is why your parents have basements.
__label__1	That will put an end to this, surely
__label__-1	He did the same thing for his campaign offices outsourcing it all to the RNC which then in turn left it up to the local offices leading to most of the effort to going to local and down ticket efforts.
__label__1	Wingers are just so damn funny!
__label__1	Who is Grover Norquist again?
__label__1	Because what could go wrong?
__label__1	Because we're such a peaceful people.
__label__1	Funny, pharmacologists have been saying the same thing for 60 years, but what do they know?
__label__1	She made that choice when she accepted Jesus into her heart!
__label__1	I'm sure that they were taken down by the damn EPA's regulations.
__label__1	Yes ... because they have it so bad as it stands now.
__label__1	and that's why the good people of LA and NY should protect their 2nd amendment right to carry concealed nukes.
__label__1	Don't you know journalists are only supposed to publish information if it _promotes_ the government's agenda?
__label__-1	Considering America voted for them, I'd say we're embarrassing ourselves by proxy.
__label__-1	I have conservative family members telling me Obama's trying to take over local PDs because of this.
__label__-1	That would be *glorious*, i'm sure Stewart would delay his retirement until after the election.
__label__-1	Australia has mandatory voting and it doesn't seem to have solved their political/economical problems.
__label__1	But it would be more fiscally conservative if they just died or killed themselves.
__label__-1	She's a failure, don't vote for this liar and loser.
__label__-1	As if his base will question the man who witnessed the Lincoln assassination first-hand.
__label__-1	This is the same woman that has repeatedly misrepresented herself to take advantage of a system she's defending for personal gain.
__label__1	President Romney can breath a sigh of relief.
__label__-1	F them and feed em fish!
__label__-1	Yeah, and pigs fly.
__label__1	Which is not at all why he said it
__label__-1	If he does win he's going to have to get congress to support a lot of the ideas he's put forward.
__label__-1	If so, the UN headquarters can no longer be in US.
__label__1	Yes because the voter base uses Twitter
__label__-1	"Yes, because in every pro-Bernie thread you see Hillary supporters saying ""oh bernouts ignore facts"" Well, they do the same exact thing"
__label__-1	Should've resigned weeks ago.
__label__-1	Thanks Obama
__label__1	Why should I pay for my neighbors infrastructure?
__label__-1	I would be sooo happy to wake up one morning and see a Hillary Indictment Megathread.
__label__-1	itshappening.gif
__label__1	BUT HE CANT CONFIRM IT!
__label__-1	Here you go: 2016 debate transcripts
__label__-1	Your anti-establishment hero ladies and gentlemen.
__label__-1	Yes Sarah Palin SoS 016
__label__1	All of 3.6% IIRC, and the stock market totally collapsed.
__label__-1	Perhaps get Ja in on this too?
__label__1	Because she is very transparent
__label__1	Trump is going to release his tax returns at the same time he releases the stuff he found out about Obama in Hawaii.
__label__-1	It's pretty sad when a two term governor isn't automatically included in the polls.
__label__-1	Probably not but they should be drafted.
__label__1	How ethical of Pfizer!
__label__-1	Decent conclusions based on behavior.
__label__-1	I suspect that this is Brownback's strategy.
__label__1	I'm sure if he just keeps digging deeper he'll get out of that hole.
__label__-1	Unleash something unpredictable happens, she's going to beat Trump, but probably not by a lot.
__label__-1	Call this chick Floyd Mayweather, cuz shes good at duckin.
__label__1	The GOP saving us from peace and prosperity again.
__label__1	Equality is being able to call a man fat but not a woman
__label__-1	(Rim shot)
__label__1	Just another outlier from an unreliable Republican-skewed pollster!
__label__1	Who better to deal with liars and crooks in Washington than a liar and crook?
__label__1	She sounds like a leader to me!
__label__1	I'm sure Laura Ingraham and the right wing spin machine are truly, truly broken up and concerned for Bernie.
__label__-1	I like how the background picture in the graph shows the assault rifle from Fallout 4
__label__-1	I want him to though.
__label__-1	A lot can change between now and June 7th
__label__-1	It's the hillary kool-aid folks.
__label__1	Don't worry guys, it was allowed!
__label__1	Wow, this is a new thought!
__label__-1	Making money while running for office is not an FEC violation... If it were, virtually every candidate for federal office, Bernie included, would be disqualified.
__label__1	Clinton is infamous for her strict adherence to rules.
__label__1	Congrats to HRC for having the foresight to not launch Clinton U.... Now I'll vote Clinton
__label__1	Bernie bros will calm down and the security review will conclude by November
__label__-1	Someone grab the deodorant, reeks of desperation in here.
__label__-1	Wow, she's that worried about California now?
__label__-1	Redditor for one month and only posting political shit
__label__1	Wow, I didn't see that coming
__label__-1	This means police are earning more overtime $$$$ - not a bad thing for the economy :)
__label__-1	"One day I want to read a poll that says ""99% of Americans polled agree with OWS that the gap between the rich and poor has grown too big."""
__label__1	Perry is desperately trying to take queues from Trump's playbook, since that worked out so well for him and all.
__label__-1	Now they can pay American workers an appropriate wage for the work.
__label__1	That homicidal and suicidal killing spree that I was planning may have to be cancelled because the bullets would cost 100$ instead of 20$ :( Brilliant idea!
__label__1	Great now all the gangs will be shooting people.
__label__-1	what huge fucking assholes
__label__1	This sounds like a great idea!
__label__1	The second Americans give up their right to bear arms, the Brits will come to take back what they gave up in 1776!
__label__1	It was a green and grassy knoll ...
__label__1	Next thing you know they will start getting uppity.
__label__-1	Jack Thompson is that you?
__label__-1	Republicans: opposing problems that don't exist since WW2.
__label__1	Must have been that powerful mythical liberal MSM.
__label__-1	PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES A LIVING WAGE, ASSHOLES
__label__-1	Impeach!
__label__-1	Sad that it's only 18... Not very impressive, nor does there seem to be any backing in the senate?
__label__-1	How much did they make from stealing oil and resources.. plenty more then their deficit I'm sure
__label__1	Yeah, because the govenor of a state is directly responsbile for the coming and going of every single job in that state.
__label__1	Yeah, because everyone can see how you voted...
__label__1	Yeah cause democrats have been so on board with ending the drug war
__label__-1	The worst part of this policy is that I get the feeling they don't even care how these wars turn out; The important part is the mountains of cash spent on them.
__label__-1	Wouldn't it make more sense for Gallup to ask non-Americans if Obama is respected on the world stage?
__label__1	It's OK, it keeps a lot of American working.
__label__-1	Deforestation is fine right?
__label__-1	Well he did ban America's use of Napalm on his first day.
__label__-1	If the Ayatollahs and their bretheren, the Republicans hate it, then it must be good.
__label__1	Well, yeah, but the rich are using that extra money to create high-paying jobs.
__label__-1	"""We sure stuck it to that Obummer!"""
__label__1	what a hero fighting the great fight against the evil IRS
__label__1	Just helping friends, what nice!
__label__-1	Marijuana isn't a cure-all, but I'll be damned if it doesn't make serious sales tax income.
__label__1	"That's ""smaller, less-intrusive government"" for you."
__label__-1	Why was there a Tesla Model S at 1:09 in the Koch propaganda video attached to the article?
__label__-1	What are we going to do about it, comrades?
__label__-1	Guys keep in mind that the economy contracted during the same quarter last year.
__label__1	I'm so glad the mayor gave these poor, disadvantaged youths 'room to destroy'.
__label__1	we need to see MORE of stuff like this
__label__1	The press is not dishonest at all
__label__-1	because bribery is legalized in the US, as lobbying and political donations
__label__1	Yep, violently attack Trump supports, I'm sure that's exactly what you should do to a candidate's supporters you don't like.
__label__-1	they just wiped the drives with a cloth!
__label__-1	Which is still a staggering number.
__label__-1	Way to twist the truth NBC.
__label__-1	"""Secret service agent to be found suicided"""
__label__1	What an edgy and unpopular opinion to have Gary
__label__-1	It protects us from mob rule, and I'm glad it does.
__label__-1	Sexism
__label__-1	Panic now that polls showJohnson is pulling from Clinton more than trump: here comes the media discredit!
__label__-1	She was trying to force his hand and he called her bluff.
__label__-1	They took our jobs!
__label__1	well if Conservative mouthpiece and FauxNews former Judge Napolitano (who has zero inside informations) says it then it must be true.
__label__-1	"This seems like a really polite way of saying ""we backed up her whole server."""
__label__1	Based upon this statement that you will not support Hillary, you clearly are a sexist pig supporting the oppression of the patriarchy.
__label__1	sexist!
__label__-1	I can't believe Bernie supporters made violence the cornerstone of theirs.
__label__-1	One ignorant loudmouth endorses another.
__label__1	It doesn't matter, it was an accident.
__label__-1	I am not surprised by this shit anymore.
__label__1	He's certainly not gonna endorse the Jew from Hymie town.
__label__-1	A Rapist
__label__1	Better than how Trump was congratulating himself after the shooting, right?
__label__1	"""nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" Just being watched by the FBI is due process right?"
__label__-1	with music so loud you cant even tell if its gunfire till you see others running, by then probably a dozen were dead in a few secods
__label__1	Because Isis had nothing to do with inspiring the attack.
__label__1	*Breaking news: Gun shop owner gets license revoked for racism*
__label__1	Hahahaha, wow I'm sure Donald Trump will be outraged by this
__label__1	You dropped this -
__label__-1	Mods?
__label__1	Spray-tan lives matter!
__label__-1	With Hillary you really have to remove all the $1 donations and re-calculate to un-crook the numbers.
__label__1	That is the sort of responsible spending America needs
__label__-1	Traitor!
__label__1	So brave.
__label__1	But guys, I thought powerful people never face consequences!
__label__1	It's gotta be because of her principled campaigning, her guts in speaking truth to power, and impeccable honesty.
__label__1	*shock* That can't be true!
__label__1	I'm with her!
__label__-1	It'd really be cool if the two main candidates didn't both seem as likely to start another war or had some sort of redeemable part about them so I wouldn't be deciding who to vote for between third and fourth party candidates.
__label__1	Because that's the job of the FBI: making voters see candidates in bad light.
__label__-1	Sounds like a good idea to me.
__label__-1	LISTEN TO PAUL KRUGMAN.
__label__-1	dithering senile bigot, and that's his legacy forever
__label__1	It would have been worse because he's not President Obama.
__label__1	This is not true because it is not reported by MSM
__label__1	I don't see this being abused.
__label__-1	SELL OUTS
__label__-1	I'm tempted to run outside screaming I TOLD YOU SO.
__label__-1	these tough-guy republicans are just punishing women for making a big deal about their rape comments.
__label__-1	disappointment with the world.
__label__-1	With what Jesus actually said, if showed up blond and blue-eyed some republican would cap his ass for blasphemy.
__label__-1	Leading while black is a very serious, in fact impeachable, offense to Republicans.
__label__1	Oh I'm so shocked and surprised that the Creationist had another agenda when they pushed vouchers -- besides impoverishing public school, that is.
__label__-1	I thought they didn't want government interference!
__label__-1	I was saying boo-urns.
__label__1	Right... because when I want reality, I immediately think of the National Review.
__label__-1	It seems to be getting nuttier to me.
__label__-1	This is straight out of an episode of Squidbillies.
__label__-1	"It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who signed the ""Marihuana Tax Act of 1937"" into law which made marijuana illegal in this country."
__label__-1	Thanks Obama.
__label__-1	I like that we get on them for using the system... but honestly, if the system was written better it wouldn't be there for them to take advantage of.
__label__-1	"""It's a joke, it's all a joke..."" - Comedian, Watchmen"
__label__1	Christ, this is some groundbreaking journalism.
__label__1	I'll bet they all were in women's studies.
__label__1	Obama might have been able to stop it if he hadn't been busy with Jade Helm 15 and the takeover of Texassistan.
__label__1	But, muh welfare .
__label__-1	IF YOU SMELL WHAT BERNIE IS COOKIN'
__label__1	But none of those other guys are black, so they're fine...
__label__-1	Its time to call the GOP what they really are: fascists.
__label__-1	Vox, Huffpost, Mother Jones, Think Progressive.... Vox, Huffpost, Mother Jones, Think Progressive.... Vox, Huffpost, Mother Jones, Think Progressive.... Vox, Huffpost, Mother Jones, Think Progressive....

__label__-1	jeb bush is a Joke.
__label__-1	She's just meeting with them to talk about grand children.
__label__1	Everybody knows that ABC is part of the vast right wing conspiracy.
__label__-1	Does she even know how to tell the truth?
__label__1	Because hillary was senator of new york during 9/11!
__label__1	Shut up sexist.
__label__1	Ah but that's OK, we are a nation founded on Christian principals
__label__-1	Obama can eat a bag of dicks
__label__1	After all the success they had with the Benghazi investigations, I can see why they would want to drag this out too
__label__-1	I wonder if the outcome would have been different if her email servers were hacked and classified info was leaked out.
__label__1	he just said he talked about endorsement, he actually probably talked to hillary about how he will never ever endorse her and his plans to go third party or endorse jill stein.
__label__1	Yes...let's tread down that incredibly popular path.
__label__1	Because they belong in the kitchen gosh darn it.
__label__-1	Hillary doesn't care.
__label__-1	Same thing that got Bill, not the actual scandal, but lying under oath.
__label__-1	The Kansan electorate is getting the government they deserve.

__label__1	I'm with ***HER***!
__label__-1	We need a business man to run our country, not Liar Liar Pantsuit on Fire Hillary.
__label__1	Yes Reddit, I'm sure downvoting this will undo all the votes for Clinton
__label__-1	Your worst nagging, lying, conniving, obnoxious mother in law dictating all aspects of your life, instead of just living in your house and telling your wife and kids what a worthless asshole she thinks you are.
__label__1	Because Putin loves America so much, he just wants us to elect the strongest and most capable person.
__label__1	I'm sure Hillary will explain all of this away at her next press conference.
__label__1	After reading this, I'm just so glad that DWS was able to land with a good job after this black mark on her record.
__label__1	You forgot this Donny
__label__1	Pay no attention to these images that were obviously taken and leak by the Russian government.
__label__-1	The same people that told Bernie supporters they were paranoid will tell everyone else they are paranoid too.
__label__-1	She is the rigged system
__label__1	Funny all I hear is cheering
__label__1	I'm sure solitary and more charges will help.
__label__-1	Dat hyperbole!
__label__-1	This is the kind of fuck up you would assume came from South Park
__label__-1	Bwak-bwak-**BWAK-K**!
__label__1	Guys he's clearly playing 4d checkers
__label__-1	"No Exit Polls Changed Party Affiliation... and if they ask, don't offer them a crossover ballot Same day voter registration law passed and signed in 2012, not implemented Automatic Voter registration law passed and signed in 2015, not implemented This is a ""conspiracy"" while the Russians hacking the DNC is not."
__label__-1	Is there anything Trump wont lie about?
__label__1	There's absolutely no bias in this study because it was done by objective Bernie Sanders supporters
__label__-1	The Clinton plan is going according to plan.
__label__1	Well why didn't she just say this in the beginning
__label__-1	"""I'm for the middle class, but I won't pay anyone a decent wage."""
__label__-1	and no pics!
__label__-1	Sure, but forget all the other logical questions regarding the federal reserve and his 2003 quotes about Fannie and Freddie saying they had no trouble at all that he simply dodged.
__label__1	Fox News - class act the whole way.
__label__-1	BTW: Links to an MP3.
__label__1	tax cuts pay for themselves, sheesh does this guy not know anything?
__label__1	Very informative
__label__1	Yeah, actually the president has very little to do with how the executive branch is managed.
__label__1	"""banished based on secret evidence which she is unable to view"" We should also trust the government with our guns."
__label__-1	Given that Rove is still in, and he was just as sure of a Mittens win, I think this has less to do with accountability than with internal Fox/GOP politics.
__label__-1	That 'younger sister' could pass for a 75 year old woman.
__label__-1	I can file a suit against Ford or GM and get in front of a judge.
__label__1	She could always make a career doing Tina Fey impressions.
__label__1	Great, now people are going to start marrying dogs.
__label__1	Gays, ruining America!
__label__-1	Bob Beckel is the new Colmes - a faux liberal that is either a complete wuss or that says dumb things to discredit liberals ala 'concern trolling'.
__label__-1	So shit never really changed?
__label__-1	Yes, but we're number 1 in monster trucks and Truck-a-saurus.
__label__1	arming Mexican drug cartels is funny.
__label__-1	Bribery
__label__1	Truly working for the America people.
__label__-1	I'd like to remind everyone that Obama promised to end the practice of lobbyists regulating their former industries.
__label__1	Remember everyone, both parties are exactly the same.
__label__1	Because what we really need are more people looking for jobs.
__label__-1	As a Texan woman all I can say is this is as unsurprising as it is utterly terrifying and shit like this is why I never miss the chance to vote in this backwards unrealistic state
__label__-1	I'm not sure if Dimon understands how the law works.
__label__-1	I wonder if she has a lot of hair down there?
__label__-1	A good article but one has to wonder how many reporters would find fault if Sanders spent hours listing all of the issues he's spent years supporting.
__label__-1	No shit
__label__-1	And our already crumbling infrastructure would continue to become worse.
__label__-1	Fox news has been riding on the backs of the 9-11 dead for what 14 years now?
__label__-1	Is anything about trump acceptable?
__label__1	As God intended.
__label__1	Gay marriage killed my mama and raped my papa!

__label__1	"Can't wait for the ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" to jump all over this one!"
__label__1	This is gonna end well.
__label__-1	Oh god, he's really stupid.
__label__1	because she 'asked for it'
__label__1	Wow I can't believe George W Bush is a CTR shill
__label__-1	This is like NPR; the thread.
__label__-1	Except they don't
__label__1	Glenn Beck is obviously a CTR shill.
__label__1	I feel triggered
__label__-1	Until the machines are hacked and the meteor wins.
__label__1	Right - the corrupt pathological liar that rigs elections and can't handle sensitive documents is way better.
__label__1	Nice, give the KKK guy attention.
__label__-1	Trump has released: * Tax Returns: No * Speech Transcripts: No Clinton has released: * Tax Returns: Yes * Speech Transcripts: No Your move, Trump.
__label__1	Complete coincidence
__label__-1	Can you sum up socialism for me in your own words?
__label__1	Crap, ten dollars!
__label__1	Where have I seen this before?
__label__1	Maybe Hannity and the rest of the Fox crew can show the other media what it's like to be party neutral.
__label__-1	What kind of an idiot would donate money for a billionaire to spend at his own for-profit businesses?
__label__-1	Trump + Daesh = Trash?
__label__-1	Yes you can.
__label__-1	I think Paul Ryan is making himself into a joke gone bad.
__label__1	Not surprised by this, a lot of people are saying it never happened
__label__1	ITS THE LIBERAL MEDIA TWISTING HIS WORDS AGAINST, HE ONLY MEANT THAT HE WANTED PEOPLE TO GO OUT TO VOTE AGAINST ISIS , 13D TWISTER!
__label__-1	That's great but let's focus on ~~Rampart~~ Benghazi.
__label__1	And if he wasn't sloppy the DNC could never call up their lackeys in the MSM and cook up some stories ... So it really is all his fault.
__label__-1	"""Trump is a visionary, several months ago he was the only one that envisioned himself as the republican nominee"" -John Oliver"
__label__1	Good luck with that.
__label__-1	And Trump thinks Obama isn't doing enough to stop ISIS?
__label__-1	She did it for the good of the party...took one for the team.
__label__1	Is this guy another Hillary plant?
__label__-1	I fucking hate this man.
__label__-1	10 points down from her convention bounce
__label__-1	There are 16% undecided...that's pretty bad news for an incumbent.
__label__1	Yeah but what does this stupid Muslim know?
__label__1	We should actually make homophobia and anti-semitism a requirement for immigration.
__label__-1	And after he points at another Taco Salad, he's bound to win the state!
__label__-1	I'm calling bull...mainly because the media now wants Trump to increase so its a closer race also the 300 people a day where are they coming from and with that are they selecting the same people over and over?
__label__1	But guys the pivot is coming.
__label__1	But all tHese polls were taken before his pivot!
__label__1	You just need more tax cuts.
__label__-1	Too bad the Republicans can't impeach him since they don't control the house or Sena- Oh wait, they do.
__label__-1	Isn't that you Trump?
__label__1	Pillows we need to talk about pillows and we need more wackadoodle doctors doing a diagnosis from afar.
__label__-1	Hurr durr we won Olympic medals so there's nothing left to improve durr
__label__-1	Discussion - will this be a *net positive* or a *net negative* in Florida?
__label__1	Obviously it should be illegal for a government official to have special access sought by other people.
__label__1	Of course, it's all a hoax
__label__1	What a right wing rag
__label__-1	Truth be told, she does give one HELL of a lapdance.
__label__-1	It's fun watching you squirm.
__label__1	Says Who?
__label__-1	Not like any Republican congressman would ever openly agree with him.
__label__1	You can always count on Anderson Cooper to ask Hillary tough questions.
__label__-1	Oh Clinton my hero without your sole voice where would we be without you.
__label__-1	Martin Shkreli is probably sitting somewhere trying to think of a way to meet her and see if she'll date him
__label__-1	Nope.
__label__-1	Fucking hell, shut the fuck up.
__label__1	"He's was just using that Trump brand sarcasm, but only ""kind of sarcastic""."
__label__1	They're not illegal immigrants if they look hot.
__label__1	those sneaky muslims will find anyway to infiltrate America's neighborhoods.
__label__1	...totally in play
__label__-1	Damn, maybe Mexico should've already built the wall... but on *their* side.
__label__1	Great argument, call your opposition dumb, that will work well in the next election!
__label__-1	cops like to play dress-up.
__label__1	How dare he fly an American flag in America.
__label__-1	What an isolationist!
__label__-1	Ever war that has ever happened or will ever happen is illegal somewhere.
__label__1	I know I was and it was great!
__label__1	Ah yes, the great teacher election of 2012.
__label__1	Just a few bad apples, right?
__label__1	because it has work so well so far
__label__1	I just can't understand why the GOP fare so poorly with minorities....
__label__1	As a white male I can totally confirm the disenfranchisement bit... why the other day a black guy had the nerve to make eye contact with me!
__label__-1	and W. Bush lied us into Iraq
__label__1	As long as we can keep the black males in for non-violent drugs crimes.
__label__1	His dad was a job creator!
__label__-1	Wish I could say I'm surprised, really tired of reading all this shitty US new about corrupt politicians and police officers, not to mention our problems in congress and the rest of the govt.
__label__1	Man all these tired, poor, and huddled masses yearning to be free really just ruin a place huh?
__label__-1	damn!
__label__1	See, we have so much in common with Cuba we just have to keep up the embargo.
__label__1	Separation of powers isn't constitutional when the judiciary disagrees with you.
__label__1	It's getting even more difficult to determine just who is on which side, but whatever Obama's FCC is doing has to be bad.
__label__-1	Top Comment Circle Jerking as usual.
__label__1	it worked so well for hospitals
__label__1	Hey, there's no GOP War on Women!
__label__-1	Because government keeps us safe!
__label__-1	Republicans: not caring about citizens or the country for over 100 years!
__label__-1	Stump speeches are not the place for nuance and in depth discussion but I bet he tweaks the message slightly to reflect the more recent reporting.
__label__1	democrips and rebloodlicans are the same right
__label__-1	It almost seems like we should stop cutting revenue streams.
__label__-1	So we can get rid of the TSA and stop using 9/11 as an excuse for police brutality, right?
__label__1	How many rapes are they allowed?
__label__-1	Fuck this fat piece of shit
__label__-1	Cowardly Don.
__label__1	Silly Mexicans, the Canadians bring us bacon and hockey and all you bring us rotgut tequila and possible daily kidnappings.
__label__-1	And isnt there little to *no* evidence that voter fraud is some sort of epidemic that the GOP likes to act like it is?
__label__-1	The lawyer who keeps pointing out how ridiculous the premises are will not be invited back.
__label__1	Trump is winning NY and CA!
__label__1	The only teacher they need is Trump
__label__1	Happy Labor Day!
__label__-1	But he's totes not a racist though!
__label__-1	The ignorance in this thread on ownership, the situation, and the city of Atlantic City is astounding.
__label__1	well it's a good thing we have a rock solid candidate like HRC that just oozes integrity and honesty.
__label__-1	"When a ""news"" outlet uses ""sketchy"" in their headline, you know they're legit."
__label__-1	Unfortunately for them, they have to get to the back of the queue of the thousands of contractors still waiting for Trump to pay.
__label__-1	Media points out trump's relative lack of support
__label__-1	GHW Bush will be happy to send him a new Ford truck.
__label__-1	I feel disgusted for having respected krugman before this election.
__label__-1	Deflect--no---deflect---no---deflect---no---well OK---rudy in deep doo dooo
__label__1	One year too late
__label__-1	Well he created Isis, so obviously he has no problem killing babies.
__label__-1	As a congested-American I think it's about time we had a sick person in the oval office.
__label__-1	Bush's Fault /Hillary
__label__1	Also he's currently being held hostage in a basement somewhere by Huma Abedin.
__label__1	Yes, this, this lie was the first self-inflected wound.
__label__1	That is very smart of them, they won't have to worry about Veterans health care being bad, there won't be any at all.
__label__-1	Upvote to show how desperate and pathetic the left wing media Is lol
__label__1	Yes, because the only way to deal with things you want to change is to run away from them.
__label__-1	She needs a free weed at college plan
__label__-1	It wasn't a shooting but where was Trump?
__label__1	No way this was stage!
__label__-1	TBH, yes
__label__1	but it's just a right wing conspiracy that the media is biased.
__label__-1	Hillary Clinton delegate opens 'inquiry' into Trump Foundation
__label__1	This explanation wont be the least bit self-serving
__label__-1	"Anytime any one says ""we cant afford to do x"" they're full of shit."
__label__1	ACLU must be in putins pocket to then right?
__label__1	This joke implies that Democrats/left-leaning independents weren't interested in her non-contagious heat-flunomia photo-op campaign trail cancellation nothingburger, which, obviously, has been confirmed by the recent polling data.
__label__-1	Isn't Vice News some kind of oxymoron?
__label__1	Hush, he has to find some rube to take Mar Lago off his hands before it sinks into the ocean.
__label__-1	Reminds me of when Obama went to the UK to convince them to vote stay.
__label__1	We did it Reddit!
__label__1	Consider this race over I guess, those huge crowds obviously mean Trump will take all 50 states.
__label__1	Only bc they believe in her vision for America though
__label__-1	He does have experience killing people.
__label__-1	"When the fact checker has an obvious agenda and bias toward Clinton, you can no longer trust their ""facts""."
__label__1	Yes, im sure this will be the one to bring her down
__label__-1	What a dumb bitch ay lmao
__label__1	The sun is gonna destroy us in a few billion years anyways, so why does it matter if we die out in the next few centuries?
__label__-1	So stop rubbing salt in it, asshole.
__label__-1	While they're at it are they going to investigate the apparent price drop of AIDS medication and cutting/watering it down to double the volume?
__label__-1	Who stopped ypu from having jobs?
__label__1	some must drown for the rest to float
__label__1	But ... but... how will Hillary take her Parkinson's medicine?
__label__-1	There's the sarcasm.
__label__-1	Should be tape delayed with pop up fact checks.
__label__-1	No shit
__label__1	Well clearly this has no potential for abuse at all, and won't create a headache for government workers trying to weed out the garbage requests from the good ones.
__label__-1	How has a third party candidate not emerged as a viable alternative to Trump and Clinton, you think if this election can't bring one out, it will never be more than a two party system.
__label__-1	It's sad we need these just to compile the bullshit.
__label__1	I never cease to be amazed at the number of lawyers in this sub
__label__1	The cnn poll which sampled 2x as many dems as republicans is up to editorial standards.
__label__1	Yeah, former governor is just awful experience
__label__1	It is ransom for the hostages
__label__1	Yet another reason all those burdensome 'regulations' just get in the way!
__label__-1	Adultery isn't illegal though, one of these things is not like the other.
__label__-1	Americorps Alum here, I can get be hind this!
__label__1	tweeting about it bigly
__label__-1	For those in the DEBATE HALL, not for the 99.99% of the other people watching at home/online.
__label__-1	B-buh mah Breitbart!
__label__1	I thought they didn't have nukes?
__label__1	30 white male Republicans from the South and Midwest, what a surprise.
__label__-1	It's like having an Angelfire page all over again.
__label__-1	Reminds me of the propaganda machine in germany and austria in the 1930ies.
__label__1	The system works!
__label__1	A civil society can only exist when government officials can operate without accountability and in total secrecy, and when the press is free to protect government's interests and curtail public debate.
__label__-1	Because nobody is paying attention.
__label__1	Sounds like a winning message to take into the 2012 election.
__label__-1	Welcome to Reddit: A circlejerk of misinformation and raging liberals
__label__1	Utah is just trying to make casting for Teenage Mum easier.
__label__-1	There is no such thing as a free lunch!
__label__-1	knives don't stab people, people stab people.
__label__-1	And would create hundreds of thousands of blue and white collar jobs.
__label__-1	Santorum couldn't even save himself with his hairbrain logic, how the hell is he supposed to save anyone else?
__label__1	You'd be surprised at all of the Canadian cartels that find a way to influence Vermonter's everyday lives.
__label__-1	I am so sorry this Jackass represents my town.
__label__1	But see, adhering to such pointless regulations made by a bunch of Washington pinheads who want to kill the economy -- that would be bad for bidness.
__label__1	Yeah they should pass something like CISPA to keep reddit from every doing this kind of damage again.
__label__1	The terrorists hate us for our freedoms... so lets get rid of our freedoms.
__label__-1	Can we just call them fascists already?
__label__1	Sounds to me like they need less oversight.
__label__1	hey we are here yelling at our pc screens, what else do you want from us?
__label__-1	Yep, in Calgary.
__label__1	That is why we need more tax cut for the job creators to create more jobs duh
__label__-1	What would happen if the blacks simply joined the GOP, en masse, and re-engineer it into something humane, by working from the bottom up?
__label__-1	"Right and at the same time 90% of Romney's voters were white, a group who's size and influence drops every minute of every day... Hence the ""ruing""."
__label__-1	Lindsey, was it because Bill was getting blow jobs in general, or was it from whom Bill was getting blow jobs?
__label__-1	He's gonna be so good at getting votes.
__label__-1	if anybody actually thinks his liberal or smart is an idiot
__label__1	I'm sure that money dwarfs the lobbying they defense contractors can put up
__label__1	If he keeps their money it will stimulate job growth.
__label__-1	At least doing that will not produce a kid.
__label__1	Of course, because preventing fertilization is also murder.
__label__-1	Because they don't know what socialism is, and take the propaganda of those who force them into poverty to define it for them.
__label__1	"""If only the women around here had the modesty of Saudi women we wouldn't have these sorts of problems."""
__label__1	Donald Trump, Constitutional Scholar.
__label__1	How dignified, I've always wanted a President who engages in cheap, vile schoolyard bullying.
__label__-1	Is he going to take them into his home?
__label__1	Yeah, much easier to set up a third party server then to just use the stupid email address given to you by the government.
__label__-1	I'm unclear...what part of this email discusses top secret information, or divulges the movement and security detail of an ambassador who was subsequently murdered?
__label__-1	Trying to buy votes
__label__-1	Posturing.
__label__1	Yea, I bet if he would not support Trump this would have never happened and this guy would be well-balanced.
__label__-1	Avg donation of $54
__label__1	You would expect a guy who tells Russia to hack into someone else's email to really care about the legality of those leaks
__label__1	"""But our military is in bad shape and the airports are shit"""
__label__1	These ads against Trump are **NOT NICE**.
__label__-1	buzz feed is crushing the political game?
__label__-1	my kneejerk reaction is to still be nervous despite this guy never really doing anything of import the last few years.
__label__-1	Even if this wasn't made up, who the fuck cares.
__label__1	Unnamed sources are the best sources.
__label__-1	Yet.
__label__1	Thanks, rich and famous actor!
__label__-1	Conservatives think because they are pieces of shit everyone else must be as well.
__label__-1	Bigly
__label__-1	Another creepy guy.
__label__1	Who let the cripple in in the first place?
__label__-1	Kind of scary when the legislative branch is directing law enforcement against political enemies.
__label__-1	True.
__label__1	Clearly he has never said those things so this is a clear example of fraud.
__label__-1	Since Clinton's ads are composed almost entirely of footage of Trump saying things, shouldn't he really be suing himself?
__label__-1	More gridlock, better have a landslide for the Democrats.
__label__-1	it's just a prank bro!
__label__1	everyone knows the leader of north Korea is Obama !
__label__1	Who's gonna believe a CTR-shilling libtard rag like RedState
__label__1	still better than having a black or a woman am I right guys
__label__-1	They did this to themselves
__label__-1	How else are we going to make America great again?
__label__1	"Because Corporations should be able to do anything they want without the pesky ""will of the people"" in their way."
__label__1	Bunch of pussy grabbers!
__label__1	When Riot Games &amp; Tencent owned the world
__label__-1	Spoken like a true Beta male.
__label__-1	Nobody GIVES a SHIT.
__label__1	I feel so guilty as a white person, I hope Obama saves us by running for a third-term!
__label__1	Damn immigrants.
__label__-1	Trump Tower even sounds like a supervillain lair
__label__1	He was trying to help Trump out even before he became the VP nominee.
__label__-1	Nothing or Anyone Bill Clinton has done, is doing, or will do should have any bearing on who you want shaping the next 25-30 years of the Supreme Court.
__label__-1	Thanks, Lebron
__label__-1	"Really because I thought you had to check out ""Sociopathy/Antisocial Personality Disorder"" on the DSM before running in US Politics."
__label__-1	And the same people who have insisted for almost 8 years that Obama is a dictator LOOOOVVEEE them some Trump.
__label__-1	Apperantly, they're loyal to the ruling party.
__label__1	Come on y'all, it was just locker room talk.
__label__-1	yes but who has better quality of care the US system many people in Canada have to wait a lot longer to get the care they need because it is state run.
__label__1	Based soley on the facts of course.
__label__1	Because Benghazi, emails, Bernie Sanders, ISIS.
__label__1	"""I have it on good information that the ancient Egyptians commonly grabbed each other by the pussy while they were moving grain supplies to be stored in the pyramids shortly after the earth was created."""
__label__1	SJWs killed my family and took my job!

__label__-1	What party is Hillary?
__label__1	The nomination was rigged.
__label__1	We are making America great again!
__label__1	But hey gotta protest vote amirite?
__label__-1	*noooope*
__label__1	Damn, the ACLU is a Russian puppet too.
__label__1	Hey post the clip that had the curtains behind Obama's head looking like devil horns and thus obviously showing Obama is nothing more than Lucifer incarnate.
__label__1	Now is really the time for a president that is already down on his knees and sucking Putins dick.
__label__1	Well, we know that Trump is really good about fairly repaying his financiers.
__label__-1	I think the word *interview* is the one that should have been in quotes.
__label__1	Yeah, gotta give the deplorables a chance to harass and threaten them!
__label__-1	So he knew he had skeletons so bad he didn't want his own people finding out about them but he didn't think anyone else would?
__label__1	So soon?
__label__1	Good thing that has no chance of escalating tensions with China.
__label__1	Yeah, this guy sounds totally credible
__label__1	She's a disgusting human being
__label__-1	"He's got to be fucking kidding me... And this is supposed to be some kind of Alpha ""hero""?"
__label__-1	But you did support him literally a week ago.
__label__-1	Hell, she even got fewer votes than an Everton player.
__label__1	Finally the promised pivot is here, game changer.
__label__-1	Lol, no.
__label__1	You're just now noticing?
__label__1	I haven't seen this posted yet.
__label__-1	Is Heritage Foundation sending Putin his talking points?
__label__-1	"This is the same guy who went to a Christian college and said ""Two Corinthians"" instead of ""Second Corinthians."""
__label__-1	"So much for ""Kerry threatening Ecuador with diplomatic issues"" if they don't like the British military storm their embassy."
__label__-1	Master mind of the New Left, Bernie Sanders reveals himself to be his own political splinter group and the reincarnation of Noam Chomsky.
__label__1	Make sure your red shirt says MAGA!
__label__-1	But so much more credibility than the Donald.
__label__1	Wow, bombshell.
__label__-1	Whelp, I guess this settles it, Donnie is a victim and deserves my vote.
__label__1	But science is a liberal conspiracy.
__label__-1	"I love how the defense isn't: ""I wouldn't sexually assault someone"", it is ""come on those women are unattractive"""
__label__-1	trump and his campaign are bunch of fukwits.
__label__1	It's all them gosh darn riggers
__label__1	"""Pfft, this time maybe, but we'll get it right the *next time*""."
__label__1	Relax, everything is going to be fine.
__label__-1	And their parents are being charged with negligence and child endangerment right?
__label__-1	Because economists are so good at predicting the stock market.
__label__-1	Woah, I'm no fan of the Nazis, but isn't that a little offensive to the Nazis?
__label__1	No, the primaries were rigged - the general will surely be all above board
__label__-1	Because it's not hard enough for women to speak up about sexual assault.
__label__-1	Where did I put my tiny violin?
__label__1	Yeah, that's a minor change.
__label__-1	My father, a life long republican voter, is staying home this election
__label__1	But he is the least racist person to walk the Earth!
__label__1	Ok I guess California will vote red in this election.
__label__1	well NYT is unbiased
__label__-1	What could go wrong?
__label__-1	More importantly, who watches the watchmen's watchers?
__label__1	Sounds fair and balanced.
__label__1	This is only a statement from the company itself, we can't expect it to stop the crazy conservative Republican conspiracy lie machine.
__label__1	Very surprising!
__label__-1	Not all heroes wear capes
__label__1	Yes, this is what you need to do to appeal to voters outside your base.
__label__-1	Yeah that's kinda what happens when you turn the cross hairs on your own party a month from the election
__label__-1	Well that's a wrap folks, Hillary is your next president.
__label__-1	While the accusations are just now being made public, the conduct allegedly occurred 17 years ago.
__label__-1	FBI reopens investigation; after finding more evidence to be destroyed and more witnesses come forward seeking immunity.
__label__1	Your grandfather is literally as bad as the fascists for using violence to fight fascists
__label__-1	That is some white trash.

__label__-1	that is some article!
__label__-1	You only hear from the loudest ones unfortunately.
__label__1	I cant wait for Trump to start the Mexican Holocaust and gas chamber all the Muslims and attack China
__label__1	But...but...but corruption
__label__-1	Gotta be diplomatic sometimes and this is one of those times.
__label__-1	takes a certain kind of asshole to run for POTUS, continuously ridicule/berate/insult HRC all the while having so many skeletons in his own closet.

__label__1	She should just let Jesus take the wheel and see how this plays out.
__label__1	It's about time this country starts practicing *real* capitalism!
__label__-1	It seems a lot of Republican candidates have little-to-no self-awareness when it comes to a lot of their comments.
__label__-1	sorry people the only fair tax, is a flat tax
__label__1	This is good for ~~bitcoin~~ the GOP.
__label__-1	GOP family values FTW!
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__1	I'm looking forward to the flood of self-analysis and reflection among right wing talking heads as they try to understand how they could have been so wrong on something so big.
__label__-1	How about we just abort the Senate?
__label__1	I'm sure there is a damn dirty liberal somewhere skewing these scientific findings.
__label__1	Come on: he's a politician, not a doctor.
__label__-1	Well that's good considering the last time her campaign went negative the birther movement was started.
__label__-1	So everyone's OK with Sharia law now?
__label__-1	this is the best.
__label__1	Watergate
__label__-1	Yeah but those 3 are really loud!
__label__1	But think about how much safer the country is (especially for your children) now that these evil cannabis cannibals are off the streets!
__label__1	Oh come on, there's so much more *speech* in politics after the Citizens United decision.
__label__-1	well duh, if anybody did what she did they would behind bars right now.

__label__-1	Taco Bell doesn't suffer from Republican state legislatures trying to make it hard for people to get Taco Bell, especially Taco Bells in minority heavy areas.

__label__1	Trump supporters are the pick of the litter
__label__-1	"It's a very sad comment on America when my first thought was ""Oh good, it's not just Florida pulling this shit."""
__label__1	genius
__label__-1	Socialism in action.
__label__-1	Considering they named a Trump presidency the #4 threat to the global economy, I can hardly say this is a surprise.
__label__1	Yeah, but at least he didn't keep a private email server in the basement.
__label__-1	No doctor should take out his own appendix.
__label__1	That's what you call unintended consequences.
__label__1	Don't worry, he'll get 95% in 2020
__label__1	Oh man it's so sad to see Justice folding to Trump's demands like this.
__label__-1	you're a crazy whackadoodle libertarian
__label__-1	Yes
__label__1	It is pretty racist to want people to prove who they are tbh.
__label__1	Stay afraid leaves
__label__-1	The world is a better place now that he is no longer on the court.
__label__-1	Oh.. now because it's in the DNC's HQ it's real?
__label__1	I'm sure trump acts fairly in all his business dealings .
__label__1	I am shocked that The Donald would have had an affair!
__label__-1	Reading that shit gives you cancer.
__label__-1	I guess I'm not voting for her then.
__label__-1	Need to do away with the EC.
__label__-1	they will vote for Trump on election day though #spiritcooking
__label__-1	Donald Trump still thinks vaccines may cause autism, and that issue is 100:0 from the experts.
__label__1	the LAST thing we need the donald's supporters is have anything triggered
__label__-1	Why is he so unhappy
__label__-1	I found that having a sense of humor and not getting outraged all the time helped me woo a wife.
__label__-1	thisisfine.jpg
__label__1	You stay classy, Nuge.
__label__1	They keep stopping us from rigging the election and it proves the election is rigged!
__label__1	WRONG.
__label__1	Man these unbiased article sources sure are making this sub a truely neutral community

__label__1	I'm so happy that fascism is in vogue again
__label__-1	"*Trump wins New York by one vote* ""Fuck"""
__label__1	She obviously was obstructing everyone else in the polling location to keep Trump supporters from voting.
__label__1	she's a woman so she has to be supervised.
__label__-1	Fox 2 Detroit reporter posted a picture of a long wait at a detroit precinct and the only thing i could think is if the line is that long, we need more precincts.
__label__-1	Someone should have vaccinated her to prevent stupidity
__label__-1	So are you going to step up and do the actual work it takes to replace them?
__label__-1	One thing I know: I never want to see or hear from the Clintons or DWS again.
__label__-1	Only if you focus on the surface and ignore the last full calendar year of events.
__label__1	Maybe the LGBT folks should just stop being gay!
__label__-1	It will now cost you money to shitpost, I hope that's what you wanted.
__label__1	i thought trump supporters were the violent ones
__label__1	Another fair and balanced piece from the Daily Mail, I guess that they're taking a break from hiding in the bushes outside Prince Harry's house.
__label__1	Yes, hillary's massage of mediocrity was a real hit.
__label__1	"""It's not racist, it's just a nuanced rebuke of neoliberal globalism."""
__label__1	Yeah, keep shifting blame because that's going to solve things.
__label__-1	Sounds like a typical game of Dota2
__label__1	"As a spokesperson for the ""left"" I think our plan is beat up each and every one of you."
__label__1	I'm sorry we have a system that prevents California from dictating the nation.
__label__1	So, we lie to him constantly while undermining him at every possible opportunity?
__label__-1	But the right is the party of peace!
__label__-1	What's her race got to do with it?
__label__-1	If they'd actually been expecting to have to transition into the White House, they'd have done this weeks ago.
__label__1	Hey, I was wondering if he would ring up Ollie North.
__label__-1	I honestly believe he wishes she had won - and is trying to figure out *some* way out of this mess he's created.
__label__1	He was such an incredible diplomat during his time at the U.N.
__label__-1	No no no, he's just very upset that we aren't doing enough negotiating in our international trade deals.
__label__1	Bring back the good old gold standard!
__label__-1	God help us.
__label__-1	Don't worry, Wikileaks will protect him since they helped put him in office.
__label__1	No, their canidate can do no wrong!
__label__-1	Leave it to reddit to cry about government surveillance of personal emails and then cry when they won't let you look at theirs either
__label__1	Trump started it!
__label__1	Oh democrats are just pissed off that Trump is draining the swamp
__label__-1	It makes perfect sense in a country with an opiate crisis where 70% of adults are overweight or obese that we'd have a self-destructive government as well.
__label__-1	"The ""safe space"" candidate."
__label__1	Don't you know it is all just economic anxiety?
__label__-1	are progressives secretly working for the rnc?
__label__-1	Enjoy your new reality, red state women.
__label__-1	But fears of putting brown people in camps is just alarmist propaganda, huh Trump folks?
__label__-1	How long before we see the cattle cars and gas chambers?
__label__-1	"Soros gives money to blacks lives matter and other groups you're dumb if you think there aren't paid ""protesters""."
__label__-1	Ugh.
__label__-1	Love how they left Cheney out of the title... Whitewashing the situation already...
__label__1	Yes, instead Trump should appoint every one that would appeases clinton voters.
__label__1	Sanders has a fine grasp of democracy, the rule of law, and fairness.
__label__1	How very American of him
__label__1	yeah, they should get off their asses and get hooked on opioids and meth
__label__-1	Well, but they can't control illegal guns flowing in from neighboring states, unfortunately.
__label__1	Sure, if Comey, Putin and Assange will do the same.
__label__1	Theyre just angsty about the economy
__label__1	But of course, trump likes women on top.
__label__-1	It sure worked wonders, especially with the all those people yhat didn't vote.
__label__-1	Seems legit
__label__1	Yes, they were equally deceitful.
__label__1	See, Trump is already doing everything he can do to streamline the government and make it more efficient.
__label__-1	Are we talking about the Clinton Foundation in this thread?
__label__-1	When Argentina is calling you out on corruption, you know things are serious.
__label__-1	This kills the whole system and means you will never see any of the money you put in.
__label__1	yup, you know its a good survey when wapo cites it
__label__1	Pshhh Hillary averaged $200k, he's not nearly as corrupt.
__label__-1	I would be there to support the Sioux people and the veterans in a heartbeat if I wasn't in high school.
__label__-1	Whining sore losers.
__label__-1	"""Their group told Podesta and Elias that while they had not found any evidence of hacking"" CNN: Let's write an article to insinuate the election results were wrong"
__label__1	Republicans are for freedom and civil liberties
__label__1	Thanks obama
__label__1	I'm sure this billionaire knows exactly how to improve our public schools.
__label__-1	But here's how Bernie can still win this
__label__-1	He vets them on loyalty.
__label__1	**definitely** sent by trump supporters!
__label__1	Fuck those experts and their knowledge
__label__1	...and Jill Stein would have won the election if so many were not discouraged to vote (or were just removed from the roles).
__label__-1	*Klaus is a moron who knows only what he reads in the New York Post*
__label__-1	Jesus, I thought we had finally heard the last from her.
__label__-1	Make America Unhinged Again?
__label__1	Really looking forward to military strikes in response to any Trump building being attacked abroad!
__label__1	lol what a shill of a website, goto the front page and no bias here!
__label__1	Totally over reacting
__label__-1	did they release any evidence for this allegation?
__label__1	"Trump heard that ""lizard people"" secretly run everything so he figured having a guy named ""Newt"" on his team might help him cash in on that."
__label__-1	That's fine for Al Gore, but good luck getting the states to ratify the amendment they'd need to eliminate it.
__label__-1	And how many of these votes are from illegals or WW1 vets who voted?
__label__1	Yes, the outgroup is to be feared
__label__1	If we've been losing a negative number of jobs in the hundreds of thousands for over a year, how the hell do we have any unemployment?
__label__-1	Dammit.
__label__1	Oh yes, everything that ever goes wrong in Egypt is Israel's fault.
__label__-1	I believe that a Ron Paul GOP bid, albeit unlikely, would **at the very least** bring a solid voice of reason to the general public's perception of the right-wing.
__label__1	Sweet, this frees up money for a few more hours of war!
__label__-1	Is this surprising to anyone?
__label__1	They need to fire more teachers.
__label__1	But come on, you guys, the money totally could have had explosive fibers in it like that underwear bomber dude!
__label__-1	Now you know why Google and all of these other companies supported CISPA.
__label__1	&amp; Stephen Smith, Glen Doherty, Christopher Stevens, Tyrone Woods, Jaime Zapata, &amp; Brian Terry aren't dead either
__label__-1	Probably has a lot of local parents concerned too.
__label__-1	were they given up or taken away?
__label__1	Yea...that'll help the US become a bigger global economy
__label__-1	So that's democracy huh?
__label__1	How could they write this, when the GOP is making major strides to change its positions on women, immigration and same sex couples.
__label__1	They just need to get off their ass and get a job!
__label__-1	Great, more inbreeds from Ohio.
__label__1	Well most are brown and every God fearing American knows Terrorists are also brown... there for it must be true.
__label__-1	but job creators need tax cuts, peasants.
__label__1	That amounts to $4.25 to $10 per person.... Wow now that'll go far
__label__-1	news at 11, obama doesn't attend every military funeral... just like every other president ever.
__label__-1	yes, that is the essence of capitalism
__label__-1	God damnit, Vermont, stop making the rest of us look bad!
__label__-1	Submission will get deleted, no all caps and better title needed.
__label__1	Someone should shoot up congress
__label__-1	Are there really people who supports Clinton?
__label__-1	Hate crime and terrorism brought to you by the GOP and the rightwing media.
__label__-1	Why isn't this morbidly obese turd wearing an XXXXL prison jumpsuit?
__label__-1	You mean, like the hyperinflation that conservatives promise every year is going to destroy us within six months?
__label__1	THEY ARE ALL RIGGED
__label__1	But they got Al Baghdadi so the ends justify the means right?
__label__1	Maybe you guys should finish up Obama's impeachment before you start another one
__label__-1	Have you ever read a review of Politifact?
__label__-1	Brooks getting schooled again.
__label__1	The world always needs ditch diggers
__label__1	Yeah we should burn down those fucking bastions of socialism we call libraries.
__label__1	"""Just keep your legs closed"""
__label__1	I thought he polled great with Hispanics?
__label__-1	"""Progress happens one death at a time"""
__label__1	Because those raped women have it far to easy right now!
__label__1	Louisiana expects a certain amount of sleaze form it's gubernatorial candidates, he'll be *fine*
__label__-1	He also is mostly to blame for the lack of security at the consulate in Benghazi as he led the charge for funding cuts for security while increasing funds for making tanks we don't need.
__label__-1	It's just smart business!
__label__1	Cause he's smart
__label__-1	the problem being WSJ said this, unless its some alt-right outlet or Fox news his base will not believe its a bad deal, they will see it as a smart move.
__label__1	Conservative thought doesn't exist......
__label__-1	Magnificent!
__label__-1	gee, I never even considered that.
__label__1	"""Wait, I thought they had signed my NDA before that phone call."""
__label__-1	#Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnd ... its gone.
__label__1	I heard she sent mail without correct postage #lockherup
__label__1	"As long as he puts 3 fire emojis and ""EXPOSED"" whenever he makes any diplomatic tweets, I think we're safe."
__label__-1	Tribes are incredibly irrelevant today.
__label__-1	Just out of curiosity did you think he was not going to have contact with his children?
__label__-1	Spending that hard earned liberal money
__label__-1	Yes!
__label__1	But Trump only surrounds himself with winners
__label__-1	is this because he is ok with human rights abuses?
__label__1	The machines they use to calculate weather patterns are SOROS machines!
__label__-1	Fuck that
__label__1	Good thing us Texans can just secede.
__label__1	I know I'm shocked.
__label__-1	That's globalization for you.
__label__1	I expect trumpets will be here soon to call out this obvious false flag.
__label__-1	Remember when the Clinton haters got their panties in a knot because they let big donors stay in the Lincoln bedroom?
__label__1	Because he neeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeer did anything secretly, so it would be redundant, duh.
__label__-1	One good thing about this is that this will affect his core supporters the most, and that's going to be funny.
__label__1	Hillary did nothing wrong
__label__1	I forgot we're totally having tea time with Putin at 1 o'clock every day.
__label__-1	So, Putin putting his puppet in the White House is no news at all?
__label__1	It is a crime not to birth proud American babies!
__label__-1	Maybe there will be an outrage if any real evidence is published?
__label__1	Thank goodness we have a multi-billion dollar data collection agency to protect us from ever having any such events occur!
__label__-1	Real question, what is the largest discrepancy possible between the electoral college and popular vote?
__label__1	We had a recent president ignore daily security briefings, and nothing bad came from that.
__label__1	TIL that smart people sell steaks through RadioShack.
__label__-1	Time to elect the guy who campaigned on undoing everything Obama did.
__label__-1	Less hilarious than the alternative which would mean only California would matter.
__label__1	ya... I'm sure The Donald's damning tax returns would have made a difference.
__label__1	ITT: I really don't see how a bunch of hopeless people worrying about dying is going to affect me
__label__1	Merry Christmas
__label__-1	why
__label__1	Unless it's smoking the reefer by those dirty hippies
__label__1	Well, they are just theories you know.
__label__1	I mean, doctors used to think leeches were great for you, so how can we really trust them now when they say smoking causes cancer?
__label__1	THIS IS WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP
__label__-1	Feathered too.
__label__1	No, please don't leave the union.
__label__1	Obviously fake news.
__label__1	fuck this country.. at least the libruls lost.. eh comrad?
__label__-1	What a *surprise*!
__label__1	"""as long as the 'libruls lost, I don't mind"""
__label__1	Gee, who didn't see that coming?
__label__-1	he's just living up to their expectations.
__label__1	But Obama is the reason I'm poor and Trump is going to turn this country around!
__label__-1	to those of them that prescribe to him having special talents, this is still an act of genius because they think trumps so self aware of his hate that he did this on purpose to boost sales.
__label__-1	I should buy stock in every publication Trump insults and short stock in every government contractor he talks shit about on Twitter.
__label__1	Hmm...I wonder why?
__label__1	This will totally get him to change his mind on not voting for Trump!
__label__1	Can confirm lost my mind.
__label__-1	This result is surprising: I would have thought the number would be far lower.
__label__1	I think this is criminal behavior, I expect at least three gop congressional committees.
__label__1	Why do you guys assume that he's a Republican?
__label__1	No Shit?
__label__-1	I wonder if the disastrous Iraq war and Bush Presidency had anything to do with this.
__label__1	I'm really sure the Republican Senate and House are going to hold inquiries as soon as possible...
__label__-1	'Cut it out'
__label__-1	"More ""it's liberals fault that I'm racist"" bullshit."
__label__1	But he self-funded his campaign, there's no way his Super PAC will interfere with his acts as president.
__label__1	Does this mean the thousands of dollars I've paid into Medicare so far will be refunded to me?
__label__1	Yeah, cause anti-Trump people are so easy to talk and reason with.
__label__1	I'm certain wages will rise to offset the increased price of consumer goods
__label__-1	Can anyone explain the benefit of being able to destroy the Earth an 8th time over only being able to do it 7 times?
__label__-1	Better not be Jewish or Catholic either because they're only white when it's convenient.
__label__1	Wow she won California by a landslide, let's have her run in 2020.
__label__-1	Haha these next four years are going to take its toll on you.
__label__1	Wow, reporting the stories that really matter, Independent
__label__1	That's just racist!
__label__-1	The credibility of Wikileaks was also destroyed this year.
__label__-1	"If we survive this Presidency...whenever there is a group picture for Presidents...I can see Trump being left out by ""accident""."
__label__-1	Both said fair comments about her, this article is wall to wall spin.
__label__1	"""You just trust us, the government to tell you what is truth and what is not"""
__label__-1	Nobody likes Hillary
__label__1	Such legitimate reporting, coming from that bastion of truth, the NY Post.
__label__-1	It will be a trump family legacy.
__label__-1	Also, they tweeted out a picture of a duck at Obama.
__label__-1	"For those who don't know, ""bless your heart"" is a polite old southern lady way of saying ""get fucked"""
__label__-1	Wisconsin did this about 8 months ago
__label__1	Ahhh.. but she kissed the ring of AIPAC and supports the neocon foreign policy - that there is Presidential material.
__label__1	You n00bies will never be 1337 hax0rz like the CEO's of AIG/BOA/Blackwater

__label__1	Because attending a christian religious meeting would end your career, right?
__label__1	Now this an issue we can all clearly unite around.
__label__1	He's making American X-mass great again.
__label__-1	We can work and pray, and live on hay and get the pie when we die.
__label__-1	This is a stupid argument.

__label__1	Al who?
__label__-1	What a supercilious asshole.
__label__-1	In other news water: wet.
__label__-1	Is it available for streaming?
__label__1	A Bernie Sanders Super PAC is awesome but ones for Republican candidates and Hillary Clinton are wrong and buying our election!
__label__1	Let's have them all wear a patch so we can easily identify them in public too
__label__1	"Guy gets jumped at a Trump rally for saying Black Lives Matter: ""Well he had it coming"" Masked white guys shoot 5 people at a BLM rally: ""BLM are terrorists"" Round of applause for reddit being consistent."

__label__-1	Fuck off Ted Cruz.
__label__1	That would be treason.
__label__1	12,000+ gun-related homicides in the US this year...but, let's focus on mass shootings as though *that's* the elephant in the room.

__label__1	Real public servants, these Republicans.
__label__1	The party of reduced government spending, everyone!
__label__1	To make up for it, repeal will also drive up healthcare costs, win/win?
__label__-1	You cannot force another country to build a wall that you want or force that country to pay you back.
__label__-1	Maybe because no fucking names or details are present in the report?
__label__-1	Yeah, you would tend to think so, wouldn't you?
__label__-1	Didn't Nobel end up being political and irrelevant?
__label__-1	"but it is a ""preexisting condition"" in red states"

__label__1	I'm 100% sure that they would have brought the same bill if Hillary had won (Clinton Foundation).
__label__1	I had no idea Rudy had IT experience.
__label__-1	I have to wonder if people in the CIA are thinking about a coup.

__label__-1	Except for, you know, the people that it made way worse off by doubling or tripling their costs and even canceling their insurance, forcing them to switch to a plan they don't like that their doctor isn't part of.
__label__-1	Trump bragged bigly about tremendous crowd as expected.
__label__-1	He can't pardon Snowden since Snowden never applied for clemency.
__label__1	More fake news.
__label__1	Don't you know you can't go by what he says, it's what's in his heart that matters?
__label__1	Man, there sure is a lot of fake news out there right now.
__label__1	Only ethics I need is from the bible I've never read
__label__-1	Jesus Christ, Hillary supporters are *still* butthurt over any mention of Bernie.
__label__1	THIS IS WHY WE NEED GUNS IN SCHOOLS!
__label__-1	The universe passes no judgement
__label__1	Speculation is inappropriate, don't steal her thunder... please wait for the announcement.
__label__1	"But Trump hires ""the best people"" don't you know?"
__label__1	But both parties are the same!
__label__-1	Did anyone honestly believe a Trump/PENCE administration would be even remotely LGBT friendly?
__label__-1	Why doesn't this sub have an [OP] tag or something for Opinion articles?
__label__-1	I really hope the leaks are steady out of the IC over the next 4 years
__label__1	He's so unfit to be president because he didn't draw a huge crowd!
__label__-1	And he's unpopular
__label__-1	So that image *wasn't* just the early arrivals.
__label__1	I would have higher ratings than Obama if it weren't for the illegals in California watching his inaguration!
__label__1	Okay but yesterday Redditors told me none of these protests will make a difference, so who cares?
__label__1	Well that certainly showed him!
__label__-1	I see a lot of beautiful women marching, you seem a little biased, probably from not seeing enough women in real life :/
__label__1	I'm sure this will go well.
__label__1	We should be more like Nigeria.
__label__-1	Did Obamacare actually raise prices in the first place?
__label__1	What a good use of our tax dollars.
__label__1	Accepting money from foreign governments makes him smart.
__label__1	No, but he's totally gonna create loads of jobs you guys.
__label__-1	The GOP should read Lysistrata.
__label__-1	Didn't Washington post r century give Bernie 4 pinnochios on this fact?
__label__1	Just wait till Jan 20 2018: Trump on a stand overlooking the parade of the Armed Services personnel, tanks, rockets, missiles, fighter and bomber aircraft while the patriotic masses cheer and wave little USA MAGA flags and look lovingly up into the face of Dear Leader, their new God Emperor as he clasps his tiny hand into a tiny fist and gives his signature salute to bless his devoted flock.
__label__-1	Wait I thought it was Obama and Clinton who had given ISIS money, weapons and power?
__label__-1	Both sides would rather take money from Wells Fargo than firebomb it.
__label__1	But Hillary is just as bad though
__label__1	Remember they want peace
__label__1	the sky is falling
__label__-1	the photo says JANUARY 21st ha ha ha ha
__label__-1	DoA.
__label__-1	Trump doesn't want to have to use #alternativefacts if the agencies put out actual facts.
__label__1	They must have voted for Clinton AND a Republican congressman- it's a well known fact that illegal aliens love to split their ticket
__label__1	"Uruguay was rated a full democracy and their ""political participation"" was rated 4.44 in the report."
__label__-1	Ok, the only way to put Trump at ease is to redo the election again :) We can't have this cloud of doubt hang over the President's head while he is trying to get shit done, so let's just redo the election so he can be sure that he wins the EC and PV the 2nd time around.
__label__-1	I hate the mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging dickheads that run this state.
__label__-1	Alternative-President trump is going to make it worse very shortly with a barrage of attacking tweets, just watch.
__label__-1	Republicans only care about deficits when Dems control the White House.
__label__-1	Are there any instances where mass **email** to members of Congress actually swayed their votes?
__label__1	See, they're totally not racist.
__label__1	That's a lot of journalists, as only they are interested in seeing the tax returns.
__label__1	exactly -- can't wait for Trump to try the same shit with China.
__label__1	Maybe the CIA should give briefings to fox so they can pass on the memo
__label__1	Why would he need intelligence briefings when he can just watch Fox News?
__label__1	American wall parts, duh
__label__1	I'm sure the government will listen to this one, just like they did for the one calling for trump to release his tax returns.
__label__-1	So basically a repeat of 2010 huh
__label__1	Cuz this is totally going to prevent attacks from terrorists.
__label__1	Surely this is the end of him!
__label__-1	Covering all the important things I see.
__label__1	Sorry Malala, Trump prefers activists that weren't shot in the face fighting for justice and equality.
__label__-1	Yeah
__label__1	Just what Jesus always wanted
__label__-1	"I don't get why I can't post RNN video ""blogs"", but as long as it's a written blog from a well-known website, it's fine."
__label__1	It's not illegal if the president does it.
__label__-1	I feel sorry for all the airport staff, like they're def lost as fuck
__label__-1	If someone blocks my entrance to Cinnabon I will lose it.
__label__1	Shieet, if this wall is going to save thousands of lives, we should build a whole lot more of 'em!
__label__1	Because fuck the Jews, right?
__label__1	But, Hillary did it, and Obama knew.
__label__-1	'Stupid' people wouldn't become President if we gave a damn on election day.
__label__1	Unironic
__label__-1	it could literally cost you your job.
__label__-1	yay more baby killing by the us military
__label__-1	Did they take the deal?
__label__1	Well how do we know he isn't a secret ISIS member?
__label__1	It's not like the tech industry is a real industry, like NY real estate or banking, which are the only real industries.
__label__1	Ah, but you see, if the Muslims hadn't come, nobody would have murdered them
__label__-1	What was that about bombing the shit out of ISIS again?
__label__1	He meant no to a black president
__label__1	I'm sure the 1,500 people they surveyed represents all of the US!
__label__-1	The Washington Examiner is not a credible news source.
__label__1	4,000 years of doing it, why bother stopping?
__label__-1	Hussein is a terrorist.
__label__-1	He has also caught more in his life time than Bush/Cheney did in 3 minutes?
__label__1	Yea but he's not going to torture them so he won't get any valuable information out of them anyways.
__label__-1	"""Hey, we're creating jobs.... they just happen to be in Mexico, China, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, ect."""
__label__-1	Clear case for the Left to have the US stop all funding of the UN.
__label__-1	It's an oldie but a goodie... Too bad it's good for nothing.
__label__-1	He can buy my opinion if he'd like.
__label__1	"""They"" all look the same."
__label__-1	Near the end of her life, when she was sick with lung cancer from smoking, Ayn Rand signed up for Social Security and Medicare, as has Ron Paul.
__label__1	My God...Newt Gingrich delivered and he didn't even win the nomination!
__label__-1	Still whining about that?
__label__-1	So what is your point?
__label__1	How arrogant for us to think that humans can impact the environment.
__label__1	pjmedia pushing for a law that forbids gun purchase by anyone not white.
__label__1	Instead of scaling back the wars, we needed to double down the surge, and take on Iran, and cut taxes more to pay for it.
__label__1	"Just another member of the ""blame America first crowd"""
__label__-1	WAY WAY unconstitutional.
__label__-1	That sounds like humans in general.
__label__1	He kept his promise, and delivered two years early!
__label__1	Well, I am glad that someone qualified to speak to the subject has now cleared that all up.
__label__1	Top minds in the Conservative party will know better than money grubbing scientists no doubt.
__label__1	How Imperial of him!
__label__1	I wonder what his speech will be like when he's re-elected.
__label__-1	Fuck yeah go ahead Texas
__label__-1	This is a very inconvenient truth.
__label__1	Quietly with secret courts.
__label__-1	I'm actually worried that a Trump win would cause a stock market crash.
__label__-1	This is only a prudent response to Democrats' failure to control genie proliferation in the region.
__label__1	Jeb can fix it.
__label__1	But politifact is SO biased and liberal, they NEVER rate a democrat as a liar
__label__1	Everyone would be employed if we broght back slavery!
__label__1	It's ok guys he will drop any day now.
__label__-1	People in power would rather wait it out than lose power....interesting.
__label__-1	the tpp is an absolute abortion
__label__-1	Is this supposed to be bad?
__label__1	With voter participation in this country so low, what are they afraid of... someone finding out that they vote?
__label__-1	If I were held at Guantanamo I would not be sending them Christmas cards once I was released.
__label__1	LEADERSHIP!
__label__-1	Yes the Globalists who hate America are desperate to stop him from making America great again.
__label__1	But sonny he represents good Christian values.
__label__-1	This is almost as deserved as Obama's Nobel Peace Prize.
__label__1	That Skype question and response certainly wasn't pre-planned.
__label__-1	I think CERN fucked up our dimensions or something.
__label__-1	but I need that agency
__label__-1	Can we have a post about all the Republicans who supported Garland when he was UNANIMOUSLY approved?
__label__1	"""incest is still ok though"" --Donald probably"
__label__-1	Scraping the bottom of the barrel
__label__-1	Since Congress can neither promote nor restrict the practice of religion, I'm not sure it can legally offer tax exemptions to a church.
__label__1	So hard for the white male :(
__label__1	We are witnessing America becoming great again.
__label__1	Well, he is a security threat
__label__-1	"I wish on the 5th of November this year every channel in the US would show ""V for Vendetta"" since the times are starting to eerily match the film's plot."
__label__1	A wall should stop that from happening.
__label__-1	Bannon is a cancer that is metastasizing rapidly.
__label__1	Just wait till all those coal jobs come back
__label__1	I kind of want to see PornHub putting out a pro-immigration video, so Republicans call for a porn boycott which would totally work out for them
__label__1	God Save the Queen
__label__1	Kelly the Con always a class act
__label__-1	aaand back into recession hell we go
__label__1	So glad we didn't elect a war hawk like Hillary!
__label__-1	Letting corporations run wild didn't end well the last time we did that but fuck it all we're doing that again anyway.
__label__1	A full anal probe
__label__-1	I believe this is of little concern to the FSB.
__label__-1	Donnie will date her in 2 years if she loses the ridiculous head comb overing
__label__-1	SHOCKING REPORT FROM MEN'S FASHION MAGAZINE: The businessman who is legendary for rules lawyering his way out of financial binds, working up complicated, intricate real estate deals, and who we all just watched run one of the most incredible campaigns of all time against all common wisdom suddenly is exactly as stupid as our narrative needs him to be
__label__-1	Thank god, this needs to happen with more regulatory.
__label__1	Fake News!
__label__1	Yeah cause the important thing to focus on is Casey Anthony.
__label__1	That seems more secure
__label__-1	And this is why the Dems must obstruct his SC pick.
__label__1	These attacks on President Bannon are so mean
__label__-1	Now can we stop pretending that calling our reps can accomplish anything at all?
__label__-1	I wonder which third?
__label__-1	The United States really needs a system where if the president reaches a 65% unfavorable rating, they are automatically removed from office and a new election is held.
__label__1	See that's true and all, but she's a lady.
__label__-1	We have no 'Free speech' now?
__label__-1	No, they dont.
__label__1	FAKE POLLS
__label__1	The Trumptards just can't stop winning!
__label__1	He's the winning at losing... /#MAGA
__label__-1	"""I write songs about riding tractors, form the comfort of a private jet"""
__label__1	Freedom brought to you by Carl's Jr.
__label__-1	You mean he lost by 100% of the votes?
__label__-1	You obviously like her because its not funny.
__label__1	All this winning by Trump, I can't handle it
__label__1	Appeasment seems smart.
__label__1	Good thing we have Trump and not the candidate who would have led us into WW3!
__label__1	Ohhhh this is the kind of bears she wanted to protect the kids from
__label__1	What about his HUD pick?
__label__1	Economists are nothing but losers that stayed in school and do not know anything about the real world!
__label__1	At least he isn't the literal founder of ISIS
__label__1	What scandals, they're all fake.
__label__-1	Thank you, yesimright dot com
__label__-1	"It's implied in the phrase, ""levying war against them."""
__label__1	This is why trump won the election, liberals calling the other side racist every time they did something obviously racist.
__label__1	All I know is: Trump isn't corrupt and he isn't catering to Goldman-Sachs, amirite!
__label__-1	Who's the special snowflake now?
__label__1	But Paul Ryan told me Russian hacking did not influence the outcome of the election!
__label__-1	"Lately, the frequency of the expression ""new low"" and the word ""Drumpf"" is quite high."
__label__-1	wasn't michelle an advocate for target clothes?
__label__1	I am SO sick of winning.
__label__-1	Saw that on Last Week Tonight, I wasn't aware someone's face could turn that red.
__label__-1	WTF I hate good relations with Russia now
__label__1	*It's only just Treason*
__label__1	"""Nothing to see here, move along..."""
__label__1	Didn't see this comming.
__label__-1	Couldn't agree more - that's why there needs to be an independent investigation or a grand jury.
__label__1	Got to love Citizens untied am I right?
__label__-1	Jfc
__label__1	Trump really knows how to pick 'em.
__label__-1	Newsflash: most of us aren't surprised.
__label__1	Citing the all-time lowest approval rating president from 72 years ago is very relevant to this discussion.
__label__1	Maybe instead of fact checking you should be INVESTIGATING PIZZA PARLORS!
__label__-1	The only way this could be funnier is if he had two Trump hand puppets on and they got in a fight.
__label__1	he's from the USSR though, so it's totally cool.
__label__-1	Literally all 10 of them must know each other!
__label__1	If you look close enough, you can see the tiny
__label__1	Is April Ryan going to be serving coffee and taking memos during this meeting?
__label__-1	What about people on the verge of becoming citizens, or DACA recipients?
__label__-1	I wonder how long it will be before this General is forced to retire... I'm guessing by next month.
__label__1	She's doing it for the kids
__label__-1	Don't worry guys, he's not taking a salary.
__label__1	Fake poll!
__label__-1	If Trump is impeached, will we still have to pay for security for his entire family?
__label__1	Bring back the fairness doctrine.
__label__1	"That would just mean 3 times as many ""illegals"" support it"
__label__1	You don't need healthcare you need to pray away your illness just like in the good old days.
__label__1	Phew, glad that was cleared up.
__label__1	Noooo
__label__1	Waterboard the little monsters
__label__1	The CIA should be privatized and Faux News can take over as the intelligence agency.
__label__-1	Alright Anonymous let's make him believe in global warming, net neutrality and civil rights.
__label__-1	Update: CPAC rescinded their invitation.
__label__-1	Our nightmare present.
__label__1	I guess the Conservatives need their safe space.
__label__-1	This fucking clown
__label__-1	At Trump Grille we have the best books, believe me, I've read a lot of them.
__label__-1	How much do you want for the bridge?
__label__1	I thought he wasn't our president.
__label__-1	"Will ""pro-life"" Republicans even care when children are starving?"
__label__-1	It's more important to hire 15,000 ICE/border patrol people than to take care of the families of our servicemembers :(.
__label__-1	he doesn't have one
__label__1	I mean if you are already growing marijuana to be smuggled into the US, why not take that extra leap into the nuclear arms market?
__label__1	But but poor Melania is the model of an American mother and wants her kid to finish school
__label__-1	Again, why else do you think I'm hesitant?
__label__-1	Republicans want to turn the US into a literal fascist regime.
__label__1	This makes a lot of sense, because why else would there be a protest against Trump in Mexico?
__label__-1	Pay to play, like everything else with Trump and Republicans it is classic, textbook projection.
__label__1	Didn't see this coming
__label__-1	Meanwhile in Canada our PM is asking us our opinion on Facebook about the coming legalization.
__label__-1	LOL that'll make your prince feel better about himself.
__label__1	If they didn't see it coming with his choice of Sessions...1950's greatness here we come.
__label__1	"Yeah, Obama's ""Deportation Force"" was nothing to fuck with!"
__label__-1	Jon Stewart needs to come kick his bow-tied ass again.
__label__-1	bad link
__label__1	Fake intelligence report
__label__-1	So more red tape to control red tape.
__label__-1	Lying about the FBI, lying to the FBI, tomato, tomahto
__label__-1	Wow, totally racist scum, and the shooter too
__label__-1	Something something false flag operation
__label__1	This is BIG NEWS
__label__1	oh well at least that uppity bitch isnt president.
__label__-1	Fixed that for you - ... want feds to *fuck* off.
__label__-1	I always golf with those I disagree with.
__label__1	Well if the white house says so it must be true.
__label__-1	Sally Yates
__label__-1	Local school boards are far better at local regulation and they have community input, top down one size fits all regulation does not work.
__label__-1	I hope they were going to cancel it anyway.
__label__-1	I don't think Orange Julius is concentrating on jobs creation and his supposed 30 Day ISIS Elimination plan.
__label__1	That can't be right Hillary was the bad one
__label__1	The more we learn, the more that Trump's claims about fake media come to fruition.
__label__1	psh, i thought everyone knew Hillary did it
__label__1	Wait i thought all imigrants were rapists and murderers.
__label__1	Look guys, Betsy had lots of black maids growing up and even a black chauffeur so it's not like she doesn't understand racism or whatever
__label__-1	UC-Davis cop has a challenger!
__label__1	Man, for someone who apparently disparaged the value of hard work, that Kenyan Muslim socialist is really working hard in retirement.
__label__1	Thanks, Obama!
__label__-1	"""is what to do with the rest of the prisoners"" Um, how about a freakin trial."
__label__-1	The ADL is a racist group for trying to stop people from speaking out against these evil acts against Palestine.
__label__1	Right, because Britain and Israel have weak militaries.
__label__1	They will integrate the new information into their thinking schemes, and after careful consideration, they will surrender the issue and go on to lead healthy, self-actualized lives.
__label__1	Proper ID would solve this major problem.
__label__-1	Come on, if we can't get the rest of 'Merica to stand up to shitty beer... Ah who am I kidding, most of my fellow Americans are content with being a wannabe Bear Grylls.
__label__1	"""I have the right to freedom, I don't want to get health insurance because if I do I will be less fat"""
__label__-1	So tell me again how both political parties are the same.
__label__1	Clearly, the solution to one person shooting up a darkened theater is having many people in a dark theater shooting at each other.
__label__1	When at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
__label__-1	way to go america, youll still be $6 behind australias minimum wage
__label__-1	Memo to Democrats: You may not agree with someone elses religion, at least show some respect.
__label__-1	Don't strike me down for being out of the loop but where did Jon Stewart go anyway
__label__1	The only reason to own a gun is to make up for inadequate penis length.
__label__-1	Everyone should have distaste for AIPAC.
__label__1	Well after all is said and done ... in the end nobody in highschool ever reads the textbooks
__label__1	Yeah because we need fewer people in the political arena speaking out about the destruction of the middle class.
__label__1	Impossible, this is all about the integrity of the voting system!
__label__-1	Holiday and voting should be made compulsory!
__label__-1	Maybe now some workers will be able to live in the city in which they work.
__label__-1	This man's hubris knows no bounds.
__label__1	The republicans don't like this because this agreement will destroy jobs... that is, jobs in the bottled air industry when the earth's air becomes unbreathable.
__label__-1	Laziest bums ever
__label__-1	This is California's fault
__label__1	Yeah but kids are exposed more often to diaper cream than weed therefore weed is still unacceptably unsafe.
__label__1	We need to go back to our previous system, where healthcare spending didn't grow drastically!
__label__1	That's because Christ is the one true way.
__label__1	Have you considered banning guns?
__label__-1	Tell them they missed a spot, or two, or a hundred
__label__1	Yeah, because George W's daughters were the epitome of class.
__label__1	Didn't ya know they're not human?
__label__-1	What about the 11th Commandment?
__label__-1	Wow its literally nothing.
__label__1	But Socialism is bad.
__label__-1	Uhhhh, there's this little thing called trickle-down economics, it hasn't been tried in the US yet but from what I've seen and what Carson told me personally at a book signing event it could work really well
__label__-1	no
__label__-1	Workplace violence nothing more.
__label__1	you're thinking of Obummer, the Seekret Muslin
__label__1	I like how the article has a picture of Hillary digging her own political grave.
__label__1	She's just that smart.
__label__1	I'm sure this would have been scheduled if Sanders wasn't leading in both states.
__label__1	Nice source.
__label__-1	"It appears that Clinton's ""it was just an NYT article on drones"" excuse may not be accurate, as more than one SAP was involved."
__label__1	...with the full force of the United States Military.
__label__-1	THIS
__label__-1	Yet if Sanders doesn't get the Democratic nod some of you sheelple here firing off on HRC have said you will vote for her....Says a lot about you.
__label__-1	Is he going to give a speech about workplace violence?
__label__1	not related to Hitler at all
__label__1	Yeah, but it would totally be super cheap if we did away with drug safety rules.
__label__-1	Rural towns will suffer the most, trump voters
__label__-1	And why is this news?
__label__-1	And they both voted for a Russian president!
__label__1	At least he's attempting to educate himself
__label__-1	People can feel free to disagree but I believe this is all becoming part of Trump's America.
__label__-1	Well good thing for Sessions he and Trump have never spoken
__label__-1	Well there goes the argument he met with the Russian ambassador in his capacity as senator.
__label__-1	They're all lying This isn't going away
__label__-1	tea bagging, more like
__label__-1	"""Orientals?"""
__label__-1	Except for being part of a shameful era in the CIA.
__label__1	Yeah this was totally the tipping point.
__label__1	Come on guys, give him a chance.
__label__-1	Call Barron!
__label__-1	I'm sorry, the small government of Mississippi sanctions what issues they deem are acceptable for divorce?
__label__-1	Cheadle has enormous hands.
__label__-1	An experiment which fizzled out, that burned twice as bright but only for half as long, where no one at the time was exactly sure of the half way point, when his madness became unraveled and unfolded before the whole world.
__label__1	Fake news
__label__-1	But obamacare lets lower income citizens have access to good healthcare and there is no greater evil to a republican than letting them be actual denizens of a first world country.
__label__1	It clearly caused lasting damage to the GOP.
__label__1	This will really help them win the midterms.
__label__1	Coal and factory jobs for everybody!
__label__-1	Why do people vote for these self serving dicks?
__label__-1	A chip off the old block
__label__1	Lone wolf, nothing to see here
__label__-1	fail
__label__1	Thank God we have a Congress that will hold him accountable.
__label__1	Yes, the important issue of our time!
__label__-1	It's always someone else's fault... you're a disgrace Trump.
__label__-1	What are they doing in resistance?
__label__-1	The president is a orange lying coward.
__label__-1	"""Agent."""
__label__-1	"Eh, Warren Buffet said it best: ""the class war is over, and my class won""."
__label__-1	In Pakistan, sure.
__label__-1	Junk opinion article that is about as long as a FB post with nothing to back up anything.
__label__1	FALSE FLAG
__label__-1	Fuck this fucking asshole.
__label__-1	The party of personal responsibility.
__label__1	You know all blacks look the same.
__label__1	The judicial system is biased
__label__-1	~~Pro-life~~ Pro-birth
__label__1	Yea, but choice
__label__1	Well they gotta fund that wall somehow, since the mexican won't be paying.
__label__1	Here you needed an
__label__-1	Kellyanne Craycray
__label__1	Nine terrorists-in-training, you mean
__label__1	This is why Trump won
__label__-1	Trump's EPA vandalizes all of America's land, water, and national parks.
__label__-1	Time to move onto another whataboutism, we've been dealing with this bullshit excuse for days now.
__label__-1	*Republicare
__label__1	Yeah because reporters like Thom Hartmann, and Ed Schultz are easily directed what to report on.
__label__-1	Wow, the definition of y'all qaeda.
__label__1	Sounds like immigrants an minorities are taking sentences away from real Americans.
__label__-1	With some McDonald's ketchup packets he found in the seat cushions.
__label__-1	Aaaaaand were all dead.
__label__-1	"Translation: ""You gotta hate the other more""."
__label__-1	...and the government won't be insolvent if we continue to give MOW grants.
__label__1	But he's a businessman, the best ever, he does the great deals.
__label__1	CEO of Winning All the Time, obviously.
__label__1	These old folks and their sense of entitlement really did need to be checked.
__label__-1	Seb Gorka has no business being a part of any government, in any capacity.
__label__1	I'm sorry but I can't stop laughing.
__label__1	Some millions of Koreans will die, but it is a sacrifice Trump is willing to make.
__label__1	Well this article must be fake - the right doesn't have a voice in the mainstream media.
__label__-1	"So, does this mean there will be an investigation into Fox News and their ""sources""?"
__label__-1	Our president is probably fucking his daughter, which is why he isn't leaving his current why.
__label__-1	What exactly is NOT an ethical concern with this administration?
__label__1	Yes, and after they were busted, I'm sure all those bugs stayed in place, especially any in Trump's personal penthouse.
__label__1	FBI to investigate pneumonia's ties to Russia.
__label__1	It's okay though because she is one of the elites.
__label__1	Oh, well, I guess we're cool then.
__label__1	Lincoln was a republican.
