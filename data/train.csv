__label__1	Hey Trump supporters, you were all 100% right: Trump is definitely *not* using the presidency to enrich himself and his family
__label__-1	What are these people trying to accomplish by telling this to someone's face?
__label__1	Both parties are equally bad.

__label__-1	Human Rights Campaign say anything?
__label__-1	well, its the same people who cry racism or sexism or intolerant bigot when they dont get their way, demanding safe spaces and screaming at anyone with a different opinion why should we be surprised they are crying now i look forward to sanders going to the convention and taking his army of cry babys with him it will provide some great entertainment
__label__-1	Because 6 Corporations control all the media in the USA.
__label__1	And he needs to amp up his racism, it is an important part of that Republican outreach program.
__label__-1	It's less than his number of electoral votes he got so obviously it doesn't matter.
__label__1	That'll show her
__label__-1	I'll just put this on my no longer relevant pile, which is piling up with all kinds of Bernie Sanders stuff right now.
__label__-1	Let the retardness begin!
__label__-1	And North Korea!
__label__-1	If he was a skilled political and legislative tactician, he would've beaten Hillary.
__label__1	Makes perfect sense, just like all the heterosexual people who do the very same thing all the time.

__label__1	Clearly, this is a well reasoned response.
__label__-1	The law doesn't apply to people with money and connections.
__label__-1	She is a fraud, plain and simple.
__label__-1	Also a compelling argument to leave religion behind in history's dustbin.

__label__1	WaPo is in the tank for Trump
__label__-1	I'm sure Ryan is shaking in his boots at the prospect of this idiot comin after him.
__label__-1	not really and her tweets were pretty childish
__label__1	How is this not considered leaking debate questions to Trump's campaign?
__label__-1	wow this is some try-hard shit, hillary lol
__label__-1	Personal blog, not affiliated with a news site.
__label__1	Yes, because the GOP that can't even pass a highway bill without simultaneously trying to deregulate Wall Street and not pay for half of it will go along with an infrastructure and health plan proposed by Hillary Clinton.
__label__1	It's not his fault that common sense has a liberal bias!
__label__-1	RT (Russia Today) - All the news that Putin wants *you* to believe.
__label__1	Just continuing Regan's legacy
__label__-1	Let's play the blame game.
__label__1	TIL all Republicans are the same
__label__-1	...but aborting a fully functional fetus is still legal, right?
__label__1	Gee ... I wonder who will pick up the tab for the rest of the bill?
__label__1	Illegals can not vote currently, this will not be an issue with outreach until progressive liberals provide non-US residents the right to vote and healthcare and yadda yadda
__label__1	They must have been allowed to see Romney's tax returns.
__label__-1	"Some ""never Hillary"" liberals told me it makes no difference who the Supreme Court nominees are."
__label__1	So if a child somehow managed to stumble on to a pro-ISIS website, the parents would be punished right?
__label__1	agreed
__label__1	Because it's going to all trickle down to the masses.
__label__1	See Trump has already made 22 people lose their jobs and he isn't even in office yet.
__label__1	Aww those beautiful Christian morals, so good to see after that horrible muslim
__label__1	If it worked in Vermont, it will work in Colorado!
__label__-1	Man, this has been the best Trump reality show yet!
__label__1	They have every right to instruct what their writers write about...Breitbart is an adult entertainment magazine.
__label__-1	Trump has already tweeted about it..... Fml
__label__-1	This could really harm his performance with the radical terrorist demographic.
__label__1	"because ""people make innocent mistakes"" how magnanimous and totally in character."
__label__-1	g*d damn it.
__label__-1	These loser generals just can't keep up with the god emperor's 387.45D Jumanji.
__label__-1	"""the c-word"" jesus I hate this"
__label__-1	"But c'mon we all loved the ""Weapon of Choice"" video!"
__label__1	of course that will automatically change under trump.
__label__-1	"It doesn't help that you've got ""news"" sites like Salon screaming about how this is about sexism, and nothing else."
__label__-1	Cancer.
__label__-1	"""The adults on the continent were talking, and I just felt so intimidated."""
__label__-1	Funny how every poll favorable to Trump makes the front page and every poll favorable to Clinton gets buried.
__label__-1	Trumpbart
__label__-1	Well of course *she* would say that.
__label__-1	Fuck off.
__label__1	Yeah I mean in a democracy the person with 3 million more votes should always lose.
__label__-1	It wouldnt surprise me if putin put trump in office just to have a president be docile towards him while he conquers.
__label__-1	"I'm waiting for the Breitbart headline that says ""500,000 women on their periods and their libcuck boyfriends unleash socialist tirade on Washington""."
__label__1	I'm sure Hillary would have been just as hostile to the environmental movement because she and Trump are exactly the same
__label__-1	Get ready for multi-million dollar lawsuits when one of the volunteers fucks up and winds up shooting an innocent.
__label__1	Yes, but it still prevents God's will.
__label__1	Can't tell if
__label__1	Lead singer of Korn?
__label__1	But the welfare for billionaires must not be stopped.
__label__-1	Seriously, what are we losing?
__label__1	But but but...there are 96 million toddlers and retired people who aren't working, so that means this is a fake number!
__label__-1	Voter ID laws wouldn't even be a problem if everyone had ID automatically.
__label__1	Yeah you're right the white multi millionaire clinton family are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better.
__label__-1	He's too busy working on Trump's eyes... Or whatever
__label__-1	It's so good to finally have a documented instance of vandalism reaching its goal, not to mention surpassing it altogether.
__label__-1	"It's probably due to the shackles the trump family keeps trying to put on them whenever them see they ""out and about and untended""."
__label__-1	I guess he won then.
__label__1	How dare voters judge me by my actions!
__label__1	Other source: Breitbart negotiating deal with the honorable Bill O'Reilly
__label__-1	Is there even a solution anymore?
__label__1	Obviously, these were all rich BLACK people.
__label__1	Yea, 3 million voters didn't do it, it was the party forcing her on us!
__label__1	Republican response: Ha Ha, 17 less Iraqis.
__label__-1	"Well, in their defense, they probably don't know what ""interracial"" means."
__label__1	Whereas no one on the right every threatened Obama's life.
__label__-1	I find people pushing for smaller government when quenstioned about specifics often want the same amount of government for themselves just smaller government for other people
__label__-1	I bet there is an out in the fine print.
__label__-1	So basically Elysium is our future, got it.
__label__-1	It's like Catch 102.
__label__-1	We used to be a place where other countries could point to as an example but it seems like so many have have left us in the dust.
__label__1	Because when I think of Hillary, I think of ethics.
__label__-1	this is the same attack used on the Bernie supporters when they stand up for something
__label__-1	Sampling error: +/-7%.
__label__-1	So a Friday news dump then?
__label__-1	Can anyone recommend me a bank that isn't full of shit?
__label__-1	He must be high!
__label__1	I'm not sure about you guys, but the swamp is looking pretty drained to me.
__label__-1	Ohhhhh Trumpy is going to be grumpy about that.
__label__-1	I totally agree - we need to profile police or else dogs/people may be unnecessarily shot.
__label__-1	That didn't work.
__label__-1	Credit unions anyone?
__label__1	Because poor people should be dead, gone, or illegal (so you can make them dead or gone, as you please).
__label__1	Hillary Clinton went on to praise George Wallace for his civil rights record and Andrew Jackson for promoting peace between white men and Native Americans.
__label__-1	What poll?
__label__-1	I thought Bilbo Sanders won.
__label__1	Sounds like the solemn exercise of representative democracy to me!
__label__1	Children must not be allowed to learn any fact based information.
__label__1	If the fetus is viable outside of the womb, why not take it out?
__label__-1	I wonder how the Trump administration's inevitable Iran smack down will affect the friendship between Iran and Russia.
__label__1	Very presidential.
__label__1	Typical liberal media bias
__label__-1	Sucker
__label__1	Well that doesn't sound threatening in any way shape or form.
__label__1	Uhhhh has she never looked up and seen them?
__label__1	Clearly Donald has let fox news in on his plan to win his game of 16D chutes and ladders
__label__1	Yes, obviously, the dream ticket for progressives who want to get rid of neo-liberalism is Neo-liberalism on steroids.
__label__1	Im sure these two misunderstood choir boys were just moments from turning their lives around.
__label__1	this is why we should block conservative judges at all costs.
__label__1	It says Sanders still has a chance!
__label__-1	Well, he's wrong
__label__1	Yes, but Obama was going to bring 360 billion refugees so your chances of being killed would be 100 killeds.
__label__1	Finally, we will be free from the Obama care oppression.
__label__-1	"No, but you can say ""I'll look into it"" and ""It's nothing to worry about."""
__label__-1	Glorious 115% approval ratings!
__label__1	This'll really help secure the undecided no racist vote for trump
__label__-1	That's just in bad taste cmon man
__label__-1	And if Hillary wins, he'll get all the support he needs to help protect us.
__label__1	haiti = blacks = we are used to giving hand outs to them pakistan = durkas = terrorists = they'll use the money to plan 9/11/11
__label__1	"a staffer tweeted ""Delete your account"" Such ownage"
__label__1	What a Populist!
__label__1	Now that's some politicians serving the public!
__label__-1	They lost their shit over that cop killer then fell silent after finding out he was a white trump supporter.
__label__1	Yea Obama been great you can tell by all the racial harmony.
__label__1	Lelt's hear it, God Bless 'merica.
__label__-1	The FBI didn't seem so sure either.
__label__-1	I'm proud of my ban from T_D
__label__-1	Redstate upset that nobody knows who Redstate is.
__label__1	If those lazy mothers really cared for their baby, they'd be able to afford a 24/7 nanny.
__label__1	Obama, the most anti business president in history.
__label__-1	Will he break up Fannie Mae?
__label__-1	Looks like Bender Bending Rodriguez made his own military.
__label__1	If it doesn't MAGA, the Supreme Overlord didn't have a part in it!
__label__1	But the DNC is a private entity so they can do whatever they want
__label__-1	Hilarious whining about how much the far right hates being forced to treat other humans with simple respect.
__label__1	Heaven forbid he takes money from the business he built
__label__-1	So many of these politicians can't think beyond their own narrow interests.
__label__-1	"The *""integrity of the electoral process""* was corrupted when states turned it into a rubber stamp instead of the stop-gap it was supposed to be."
__label__-1	I bet it's Alabama or something... Click link Nailed it!
__label__1	The Republican legislators probably want instructions on how to poison people in their own states.
__label__-1	A neutered republican party is just what this country needs.
__label__1	Come on guys, stop up voting hard right fringe media outlets like the Chicago Tribune
__label__1	yes, because a nation should always prioritise having more wars than sports
__label__1	In front of a remarkably tiny crowd he claimed they were winning.
__label__-1	Why not cut to the chase and add some Organized Crime figures in there as well.
__label__1	Clearly this is why it is better to have local communities with all the power.
__label__-1	Whoever wins, we still lose.
__label__1	But don't worry, they'll totally be entitled to due process.
__label__1	Oh OP; don't you know it's only welfare when poor urban blacks do it.
__label__1	Oh yeah, if we had just bankrolled more money into the system then they wouldn't have hacked!
__label__-1	She might drop dead at any moment
__label__1	But, ....Sanders supporters can't take over the party, because Hillary won the primary and got way more votes than Bernie.
__label__1	Because he spent $100,000 on the fountain the craftsman who built the fountain was able to open a small business and employ 12 people.
__label__-1	At this point I'm just going to assume that anyone who signs on with Trump is actually signing up to be a talking head analyst on the Trump News Network.
__label__-1	As if I give a FUCK who Jesse Jackson endorses.
__label__1	omg, he must be dying!
__label__-1	putting on my hip boots, it's getting real deep.
__label__-1	I say this as someone who genuinely likes Hillary and finds myself wearying of Bernie: Buuuuuullshit, Shelly.
__label__1	Wow, never seen this question before.
__label__1	Because Wall Patrol is more important than Paw Patrol kid.
__label__-1	With an advisory board that large, nothing will get done
__label__1	everybody loves him buuuuuut he cant win so none of us will vote for him
__label__1	Shame he didn't run for president or something.
__label__1	But you're white, so you MUST be a racist.
__label__1	It's fine Trump is playing 4D chess and will use them all for his plans.
__label__1	So should we do a poll tax or a reading test?
__label__-1	Lol at the people thinking this is hypocritical.
__label__-1	The stock market is rigged against you
__label__-1	To be fair, these 10 Trump weeks have felt like two Obama years.
__label__-1	See also: brownshirts.
__label__1	Yea, but he meant the black guy.
__label__1	Dont worry about it, voterID will fix it.
__label__1	Oh OH is he going to hire ~~acorn~~ the Koch brothers to bus illegals in to fill out the crowd?
__label__-1	And this surprises anyone?
__label__-1	Clearly Bernie doesn't want to go back to his former life of getting post offices renamed any time fast.
__label__-1	Diplomacy is the art of getting what you want and shooting anyone who disagrees in the face.
__label__-1	Little late guy
__label__-1	Yup this is what we would do if we want this war to never end.
__label__1	If anyone can prove that Donald Trump doesn't objectify women, it's Melania Trump.
__label__1	Ya, because we all remember that gay kid in school that bullied all the football payers.
__label__-1	That was proven false you fucks
__label__1	They forgot to add the major fuck ups, blow it's, and legal troubles that have plagued the conman for decades.-- What's up with that?
__label__-1	Technically, a barking female dog is a bitch.
__label__1	Breitbart...the bastion of objective journalism.
__label__-1	it sets a precedent, and the battle's lost.
__label__-1	Michelle Obama is not to blame for school dieticians' inability to curate better recipes.
__label__1	Libs so butthutt, love it
__label__-1	a good chunk of this sub.
__label__-1	Nothing demonstrates love of all God's children or offers a sign of peace like a firearm.
__label__1	Its not about which candidate would do the best job, its about what supporting them says about me.
__label__-1	tis but a lie
__label__-1	What a joke.
__label__1	Yeah, fuck those white people, amirite?
__label__-1	Or a kill switch on the moderators desk.
__label__1	Cause TV news NEVER bumps anyone and always tells you why they make their internal decisions.
__label__-1	Funny how all the complaints about the current system are coming post election.
__label__-1	This is literally one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.
__label__1	We all know the economy was crashed by soaring tax rates and over regulation!
__label__-1	Please proceed.
__label__1	Smart Senator, if they are dead they don't need care.
__label__-1	Bullies always pick on the weak.
__label__1	We need more female waterboarders, for equality.
__label__-1	We just call them police.
__label__-1	Not when you have to turn it over at the end of your tenure
__label__1	It makes me nervous seeing all these thugs in the streets.
__label__-1	But all those phantasmal manufacturing jobs and WINNING!
__label__1	Ruining the Christmas present of a family member putting his name on a cause he doesn't support, what could possibly go wrong?
__label__-1	The only thing that i agree with on this (god)forsaken site.
__label__-1	now that's fucked up !
__label__1	Mother Jones has always understood the new young republican movement.
__label__-1	I've been following things pretty closely and although I have seen her introduce Sanders at a couple times, and have seen her name mentioned a couple times, and have seen her name mentioned a couple events, I didn't know most of the stuff in this article.
__label__1	I don't understand, Reddit told me that Hillary got a negative convention bump and that Trump had nowhere to go but up.
__label__1	So a rational person would have asked themselves 'why are two Muslims in bar', then shoot them.
__label__1	Hillary's campaign travels halfway around the world before Bernie's puts its shoes on
__label__1	but hes 200 years old he is not as smart as our generation, i mean we have computers!
__label__-1	I suppose it doesn't make much of a difference since they have no problem flat out lying to the press on any issue, large or small.
__label__1	Repost.
__label__1	Yeah you know, not Korematsu that rubber stamped FDR's executive order to illegally imprison Japanese Americans... not Dredd Scott declaring that black people weren't people... no no, Citizens United, when the left tried to go after a non-profit group for making a documentary highly critical of Hillary Clinton - oh yes, that's the worst Supreme Court decision.
__label__-1	Is there a chance that Sanders and Trump run independent?
__label__-1	Powerless white boys stiffening their cocks on hate and false superiority.
__label__-1	"""communicate directly with his followers"" Followers...cults have followers"
__label__1	Good thing the popular vote is how we elect the president
__label__1	Pro-Life!
__label__-1	We all know it's just a distraction
__label__1	His twitter account?
__label__-1	Medicare Advantage plans were created to take *advantage* of seniors and the disabled.
__label__1	But America first!
__label__-1	Dead mothers, too.
__label__-1	That would make sense... she is the establishment candidate, after all.
__label__1	A bunch of drunken terrorist bombers called him a war criminal!
__label__1	Third party candidates are disruptive to the narrative and only serve to confuse people who want to think they really have options.
__label__-1	Almost like they realize they're doing shameful things.
__label__-1	Fox News: Obama!
__label__1	Hey man, both parties are the same.
__label__1	"Yeah, since he himself didn't perform the abortions, it's okay for him to use the ""tissues"" for necessary research."
__label__-1	Supports my Wikitroll theory
__label__-1	Not nearly as badly as is going to happen (and is happening) with Trump, he's shoveling money towards the wealthy with a snow shovel, nearly.
__label__1	By making them suffer it not only lets them experience true Christian love like Jesus did, but also encourages them to not be poor...

__label__-1	Anybody else disappointed?
__label__-1	Lobbying congress and giving politicians is fine but if those motherfuckers shutdown a PRIVATE WEBSITE FOR PRIVATE REASONS it's abuse.
__label__-1	Shows you just how dumb the former is, and how it is good that everyone isnt that stupid.
__label__-1	Welp, seems I have found my religion/church.
__label__-1	They'll all go to war, stop lying to yourself.
__label__1	Don't worry, Dick Cheney will personally stand up and accept responsibility for this shameful practice and the results.
__label__1	Oh great, more liberals controlling the minds of our youth
__label__1	Oh, well since Miley Cyrus said it I may have to change my mind about Hillary.
__label__-1	Giving this man more attention was exactly what he wanted.
__label__1	Yeah, lets vote on it Bernie.
__label__-1	Hillary should not have laughed it off, but I don't see how that makes her anti-woman as the RNC is arguing.
__label__-1	Pretty fucking bad timing for this headline!
__label__1	Yes, we can see the new Congress running to the aid of the average Joe from day one.
__label__-1	If we could STOP THE MONEY, it would end.
__label__-1	Gotta love that username.
__label__1	the trump hating media didn't cover it
__label__-1	Disgusting constitution-hating asshats.
__label__-1	agree.
__label__1	I'm sure the US military in those countries won't have any problems recruiting translators and guides there after this.
__label__-1	is this expected or should i be surprised Trump didn't get the nod?
__label__-1	shitposting to the max.
__label__1	why don't socialists want to be hungry?
__label__-1	If he pushes TPP through that will push even more people to Trum/not vote at all.
__label__-1	it's fantastic how much Trump broke liberals' brains that they're calling him the loser of the election without a trace of irony LOL
__label__-1	Jesus, so do I.
__label__1	As long as it's him, with enough fuel for a one way trip.
__label__1	Just another example of how McCain isn't a 'real' Republican
__label__-1	She's still pissed off about the one star.
__label__-1	"He'll wait to gauge public opinion and then ""mishear"" it."
__label__1	don't attack the source!
__label__1	But it makes them feel terrible about themselves so its all good
__label__1	Yeah, Trump is the only candidate who threatens national security.
__label__-1	I refuse to succumb to the chilling effect
__label__1	But weed isn't addictive
__label__1	But all you have to do is vote!
__label__1	From the number of times I have read about fines and settlements reached - monetary punitive measures really seem to be fucking working.
__label__-1	And of course the WH is saying it's totally fake.
__label__1	Bern it down!
__label__-1	Awwww boo hoo :c
__label__1	Hey guys don't worry, he's not wrong, he's just using alternative facts!
__label__-1	Cock
__label__-1	the West coast is already preparing for war in courts to prevent drilling in the Pacific.
__label__-1	Don't forget they can crash out markets.
__label__-1	This from the Worst Mayor of New York City in a century.
__label__-1	You already pay extra on April 15th every year because the minimum wage is low.
__label__-1	Is there anything left of the State Department ?
__label__-1	Obligatory Thanks Obama.
__label__-1	*Slumlord
__label__1	NYT, WaPo, and HuffPo are in the tank for Trump.
__label__-1	Probably trying to squeeze in some heinous legislation before they lose the Governor
__label__-1	Where are *our* jobs?
__label__-1	Who the fuck cares?
__label__1	*If Hitler did it, its good enough for us*
__label__1	Well, America showed it doesn't care about family, so why should he?
__label__-1	"""Republicans: Good for the economy"" MY ASS!"
__label__1	AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
__label__1	Yeah, we really give a shit about what Paul Ryan has to say
__label__1	Because no one hates *liberty* more than *liberals*
__label__1	Beheadings next?
__label__1	You only don't like her because shes a woman
__label__-1	"Last guy who said ""read my lips"" turned out to be a liar too."
__label__-1	We must make sacrifices for progress i suppose.
__label__-1	Can't they just subpoena them?
__label__1	I thought they were only worth 1 billion?
__label__1	But regulations are just more red tape on the glorious free market and will cost jobs!
__label__1	Wow, George Soros is BUSY!
__label__1	How close minded to force the gay guy to be the secretary
__label__-1	One way he saved money in the past was to refuse to pay contractors.
__label__1	It's still better than just 23 people contributing 65.6 mill.
__label__-1	And while your at it.... seatbelts... and helmets.... and ..and and.... food inspections.... if it works and a Republican someplace at any time had a beef with it repeal it too
__label__1	So presidential
__label__1	That is just the dementia talking
__label__1	But all Republicans are still evil mouth breathers
__label__-1	Also shouldn't be running for president, most say.
__label__1	Well I didn't see that coming!
__label__1	Wow, he's a pretty bad Muslim
__label__-1	attaboy, tim!
__label__1	That sounds like something an Islamic terrorist would say.
__label__-1	still better than the first party candidates tho lolololol
__label__1	Now that's a shower I'd like to watch
__label__-1	Yes, and it's free, thanks to the Trump EPA.
__label__-1	I'm curious how that would flip if men had to announce who they voted for?
__label__-1	But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
__label__1	Lies!
__label__-1	No one else was going to forgive him
__label__-1	Ron Paul does not believe in evolution
__label__-1	No one claimed they were brilliant.
__label__1	Trump clearly has a ceiling
__label__-1	I'll believe it when I see it.
__label__1	Someone has to think of the fat cats
__label__-1	"""Terrorist"" of course meaning ""someone I strongly disagree with."""
__label__-1	Just think of all the jobs that would be created when a grassroots rickshaw industry sprouts up because no one can get around their cities anymore and roads are clogged with single-occupant cars!
__label__-1	How is this news?
__label__-1	"The house has passed 29 bills to try and help hiring by removing some ""red tape"" none of which have been allowed on the senate floor."
__label__-1	From the man who threw a fit because someone was sworn in on something other than a bible.
__label__-1	Rachel has to be a little conflicted about this, I'm sure.
__label__-1	If I felt a single vote could afford to be wasted, this is the person I would waste it on.
__label__-1	The system is fucked.
__label__1	What are you, some kind of terrorist lover?
__label__1	Of course the black guy is cracking down on slavery.
__label__1	"""allow votes"" wow what a great democratic system"
__label__1	But he wrote a strongly worded email!
__label__-1	Improving 'Access' to Heaven.
__label__-1	Well, they did beg Uncle Sam to help them against Mexican farmers and peasant
__label__1	and I'm sure their white whale is still at large out there somewhere
__label__1	Dont whine communists, get a job!
__label__1	So far this presidency has been a hole in one
__label__1	That's just proof of how deep the conspiracy runs!
__label__-1	Only one of these things is a Constitutionally Protected human right.
__label__-1	Up.
__label__1	Experience schmerience
__label__-1	Yes, that's basically it.
__label__-1	Those pics need more jpeg.
__label__-1	Unashamed racial profiling of Muslims goes a long way too
__label__1	Wow what a great headline, it named 3 people I don't relate to on any level.
__label__1	DWS
__label__-1	Yawn.
__label__-1	In a continuing abdication of all adult responsibility, republicans will just blame obama
__label__-1	YEAY.. look at the Republican propaganda machine.. they are like those annoying people who have to one up you with their own story.
__label__1	Let's just hand over the keys to the economy to a guy who can manage neither his campaign finances nor his tax returns, what could go wrong ?
__label__1	"The ""gotcha"" media at it again."
__label__1	Yeah, every woman who has a miscarriage is guilty of manslaughter.
__label__1	Well, Madoff is a trust worthy guy
__label__-1	Chew with your mouth closed.
__label__1	Did he used to be a crossdressing waitress -- is he speaking from experience?
__label__-1	So Nordstrom dropping your daughters clothing line is a terrible thing, a Russian spy shit operating in US waters is not good?
__label__-1	That's some good shooting...... score one for the good guys.
__label__-1	the gop are racist cunts.
__label__-1	Someone should tell her that Trump can't deport people.
__label__1	Looks like you guys gotta just murder your politicians like they do in Russia and that fixes things
__label__-1	All tax plans are horrible and wildly immoral, let alone irresponsible.
__label__-1	Anti-American, but very pro-puppet.
__label__-1	No reason to believe it we just do.
__label__-1	Donald Trump is on the wrong side of almost every issue some voters care about.
__label__-1	He's gonna keep feeding his scapegoats to the wolves as long as people keep volunteering to be his scapegoat.
__label__1	What is this guy trying to say though?
__label__-1	Considering the cost of the value offered by colleges these days I'd say that headline should be 'Young Households Are Losing Ground in Income *Because* of Education.'
__label__1	Yeah, but those people are mostly poor, black or disabled, so it's all good!
__label__-1	Good times.
__label__1	dude, all that matters is jesus!
__label__-1	LOL That riled up the rightards.
__label__-1	"this isn't really a revelation, most of what we've done in that region ends up being ""for Israel"" in some way."
__label__-1	the one that makes me feel i don't need to sign a prenup just to board an airplane
__label__1	Trump should auction off a chance for someone to hit him in the face and give the money to himself as charity.
__label__1	But it should have been Bernie!
__label__1	I'm sure Mexico is good for it, despite the fact that they've repeatedly said they won't pay for it.
__label__1	finally someone with some experience!
__label__1	Now we know what the new rules are: open carry for whites, open season on blacks.
__label__-1	I'm willing to bet this ends in nothing happening.
__label__1	Out of the shadows and into the light Hail Hydra!
__label__-1	the orcs have developed a strategy
__label__-1	There are two ways to play the race card, the way Obama did it and the way Bannon is doing it.
__label__1	Don't worry, it's just a scrap of paper anyways
__label__-1	South Dakota republicans showing they dont understand the first amendment
__label__1	1:48 seconds in and they are talking about detention centers for immigrants that commit crimes...That worked so well for us when we did it to the Japanese, surely it'll work this time too.
__label__-1	It's just a 4 million years cycle
__label__-1	And after they debates it'll be a 10 point lead over trump
__label__1	Glad he has his priorities straight and tackling the real issues first
__label__1	Time to include the UK on that travel ban with the Muslims and the refugees?
__label__-1	Delightful.
__label__1	What was Walker's major?
__label__-1	WOW
__label__1	Thanks Bernie!
__label__1	That's because both parties are exactly the same.
__label__-1	I'm sure you understand how conservative women think HuffPo
__label__1	But then people can silently kill others like In Goldeneye!
__label__1	Very first lady like.
__label__-1	notice the whiners in this post all try to kill the messenger, have little substance to add about the story itself...almost as if they support jindal and the GOP jihad against modernity or something
__label__-1	"Its things like this that make me sincerely doubt that Islamophobes actually hate Muslims because of ""how Islam treats women."""
__label__1	Because they will be millionaires like Romney one day!
__label__-1	I look forward to the crayon drawn picture of Obama suspended from the ceiling planting bugs in Trump Tower.
__label__1	Coming from someone who potentially could've had our country with Sarah Palin as 1st in line to the presidency, this means a whole lot.
__label__1	Some hard-hitting investigative journalism.
__label__1	I feel safer already.
__label__-1	"The headline might as well have said ""Three of the country's wealthiest Starbucks drinkers saw their net worth grow by more than $3.7 billion, the entire cost of a 1,000 coffee shops."""
__label__1	How shocking that the Grand Bigot Party hates gays, Hispanics, Blacks...
__label__-1	Trump lied soldiers died Naw, it sounds stupid when we say it too.
__label__1	Trump's fool proof ask them system would prevent that
__label__-1	Tldr- homie has a pension he earned as a public servant
__label__1	But the files were not on an email server so it's all good.
__label__1	And 9-11 was an inside job
__label__1	But he didn't mean wiretap!
__label__-1	Thanks for your service.
__label__1	well, that was a helpful comment.
__label__1	A group of people doing something that the law specifically allows... Clearly we need to stop them
__label__-1	Better to be unqualified than **disqualified**
__label__1	Why not, what could possibly go wrong?
__label__-1	omg wtf

__label__1	Because gay marriage is a wedge issue and these calls for violence are purely rhetorical.
__label__-1	It's as if Bernie fans are republicans, it's kind of funny.
__label__1	We will NOT punish the Job Creators.
__label__-1	"Should be called the ""Supporting children for the protection of their futures act"", a la Lamar Smith."
__label__-1	How is this political?
__label__-1	AP is so anxious to defeat Clinton, they let their veil drop and revealed they are, like Fox, just another PR branch of conservative Republicans.
__label__1	I'M NOT STRESSED OUT.
__label__-1	He thinks his personal politics are more important than his job.
__label__1	Remember, you are living in a post racial world, so this is obviously a lie.
__label__-1	New superheroes: The Uncredibles

__label__1	He must've really pissed off Al Gore, since you know he invented the Internet.
__label__-1	Christ Christie is a fat dickhead
__label__1	It's worth nothing that there are no uncivil jerks in the federal government.
__label__1	Something this mean-spirited and vile could only come out of the democratic party.
__label__1	I wonder what would have happened if all the people that approve of him had gotten off their asses and voted
__label__1	If only her son hadn't married that slut!
__label__-1	Oh shit, please don't let her pick her Dad.
__label__1	Don't worry Trumpsters, he's got great leverage.
__label__1	"yeah, but it will be when Donald is finished with it and then he will go ""SEEEE folks...I told you it was horrible, shameful, the worst shape"""
__label__-1	that's just what a Muslim demon founder of ISIS would say.
__label__1	Dont worry Texas, God will fix all your problems.
__label__1	Makes sense since no Hillary voters work
__label__-1	The Obama administration in put out blatant lies as fact -- ignoring any questions or complexity -- and spun the story when it broke (and most people will only pay attention to the story and its details then).
__label__1	Oh, that was just locker room banter
__label__-1	He's trying to distract you.
__label__1	He's a republican, he just did that to avoid paying taxes on the $175,000.
__label__-1	Fucking cant stand her accent
__label__-1	GOP=Dixiecrats
__label__1	Spicer has such a good record on these things.
__label__1	It was 9/11/1996, right?
__label__1	No guys it's just fake news if it's against trump in any way, FAKE I TELL YOU
__label__1	This is a wonderfully non-biased web site you posted here.
__label__-1	Because the Republican platform is always pro establishment and pro ruling class they cannot win unless they lie, cheat, and steal.
__label__1	But at least we get to pay for a wall!
__label__-1	Ones got a kill list the others got a wall it'll make one hell of a TV show
__label__-1	Why do I bother to read crap like this?
__label__-1	We got the head of the judicial branch, legislative and executive branch this year!
__label__-1	Because his track record with his marriages have been great
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__-1	But, why though?
__label__-1	Probably because the role of the president has has sprawled well out of scope compared to the job description.
__label__-1	Upvote in hopes that Bush's worry comes true!
__label__1	obviously obama will be opening up a mosque in a hidden location since he is a crouching christian hidden muslim.
__label__-1	Obama may be remembered fondly as the first minority president, especially as demographics change and the minority becomes the majority, but putting him among the greats is a little bit of a far stretch.
__label__-1	i think that wall was built a long time ago brah.
__label__-1	Who cares?
__label__-1	Sure, we can eliminate minimum wage right after we implement a national guaranteed income for all American citizens.

__label__1	You mean those Redditors that gave Bernie the nomination?
__label__1	I am surprised Huffington Post missed this great story
__label__-1	Innuendos are the weapon of the billionaire class.
__label__1	Lol ok yeah nothing shady about that
__label__1	Remember when the free market took it upon themselves to clean up the Cuyahoga River when it kept catching on fire?
__label__1	This is a shocking development
__label__-1	"All this means is that the Republicans will now blame each other for letting the Dems ""get away with Benghazi""."
__label__-1	You can always count on Republicans to shaft the troops.
__label__1	Just call it a good shooting and move on.
__label__-1	Do they really expect to win with this type of shit in 2016?
__label__1	I hear he has a yuuuge line of credit...from a Russian state-owned bank!
__label__1	Perhaps people can live there when the Red Wings are not playing a game.

__label__1	With stupid like that behind you, how can you lose.
__label__1	He won, get over it.
__label__-1	I downvoted this post due to the title not being fully accurate to what the article is actually about.
__label__1	But then how will they save daylight?
__label__1	Freedom of speech isn't actually freedom of speech it's the freedom to say things that we don't tell you that you can't say.
__label__1	boy I sure am glad we have all these wonderful legal protections and unions are not needed right?
__label__1	I'm so surprised that such a respectable outlet as the daily mail would just lie in their headline so blatantly
__label__-1	Sure, because nothing gets people in your side like intimidation.
__label__1	Remember young voters are uniformed idiots, unless they are voting for Trump or Hilary.
__label__1	Withholding aid has been successful in getting North Korea and Cuba to change their ways also.
__label__-1	Please, like conservatives can afford Starbucks.
__label__-1	Don't we have bigger things to worry about than if I pay $15 more a month on my Internet?
__label__-1	they are not going bankrupt, and to Trump, that is the only positive business thing he knows.

__label__1	Were is the profit in that?
__label__1	"""The Media"" is a notoriously monolithic entity, known for its secrecy, restraint, and reservation."
__label__1	The important question we need to be asking is - how does this proof that Obama wiretapped Trump and his other political opponents?

__label__-1	Well they didn't say that.

__label__-1	I keep thinking, we were at different times a pretzel and a shoe strike away from Cheney being president.
__label__-1	Before you get up in arms, do the math - the suicide rate of soldiers is not statistically different than that of civilians
__label__-1	Just interesting to notice that right wing sites, fox, wnd, are reporting this exactly opposite, as in the evil anti-trump protestor pepper sprayed the peaceful pro trump demonstrators who had to react in self defense.
__label__-1	This being Reddit no one is going to actually fact check this before grabbing their torches and pitchforks.

__label__-1	We can all stop with the NSA spied on _ _ _ _ _ _ _, they spy on the planet.
__label__1	Oh MSM you liar you, the real poll is right there on briebart showing 95% support.
__label__1	Well I'm sure the media will be satisfied now and stop hectoring him
__label__-1	Political hack
__label__1	Trump got a Purple Heart and he didn't get no PTSD!
__label__-1	The second amendment was intended to avoid having to maintain a standing army.
__label__1	I'm sure every national leader in East Asia is really thankful that instead of meeting to discuss shit diplomatically you instead decide to fuck off early and provoke North Korea with nuclear war on the way out.

__label__-1	you never know, after all trump and pence say some crazy shit
__label__1	It will be great to see the 20th century again.
__label__1	That just proves Trump was smart and ahead of his time.
__label__-1	I really hope it's not another 70 minutes of demented narcissistic ravings, but it probably will be.
__label__-1	I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.
__label__1	There's a plum ambassadorship at stake here!
__label__-1	I hear Republicans across the south are outraged at such behavior!
__label__1	Yes, an emoji and not actual policy and solutions ought to fix this!

__label__-1	I dont think that people working full time live in poverty in Luxembourg
__label__1	"""Fake Polls"" , all of them, they are all out to get Trump."
__label__1	I 100% trust that he will not change his mind again.
__label__-1	Judicial Watch are having an angry cry today.
__label__1	Sex and erotic videotapes oh no.
__label__-1	Every time Trump demands funding from Congress for his silly wall, Democrats need to remind the President that their refusal helps him keep the promise he made to the American people during his campaign.
__label__1	Can I get an Amen!
__label__1	I knew this was all a big misunderstanding!
__label__1	Oh, I'm sure it's just a few bad apples.
__label__-1	This isn't going after fuck all, it's another bullshit non-sequitur.
__label__1	"Its just a ""parking ticket"" everyone chill out."
__label__1	But why would the ~~Ministry Of Truth~~ Press Secretary lie?
__label__1	This guy is just great at making friends, isn't he?
__label__1	You go girl?
__label__1	I am sure Wisconsin democrats are ready to take voting advice from Breitbart.
__label__-1	"""After 15 hours people decide to do their job"""
__label__-1	The press should counter with a list of terrorist attacks Trump took lightly.
__label__-1	Tldr they Raye Sanders supporters claims as FALSE.
__label__-1	hahahahahahahahaha
__label__-1	Truth is still the first casualty of war, for a populace armed with the truth will quite likely not support actions that would result in the death of their sons and daughters.
__label__-1	But Gary Johnson isn't going to give out any free stuff, why would I support him
__label__1	Nice to see they care about cancer patients.
__label__1	"""Fake news"" because I disagree with it"
__label__-1	First Amendment Rights only apply to corporate persons, not real human beings.
__label__1	She is so dumb for quoting him verbatim
__label__-1	Says the guy who illegally stole his seat of office.
__label__1	Look at all those Bernie bros.
__label__-1	Pics or it didn't happen.
__label__1	I heard he is also a first rate toilet cleaner, so having him as an ambassador would be huge as far as the hygiene of the British embassy.
__label__-1	Is there any piece of liberal propaganda garbage that redditors don't vote up?
__label__-1	Fuck you Chaffetz.
__label__1	He left to threaten the NFL to let the patriots come back after a 25 point deficit.
__label__-1	It wasn't, and Obama already recognized that it wasn't.
__label__-1	Don't worry special snowflakes, those donations are going to be the only things keeping your organization alive within a couple years
__label__1	A true patriot.
__label__-1	Hopefully they test it by launching it up his ass.
__label__1	Everyone be sure and thank her for the Trump administration.
__label__-1	Because shes an idiot?
__label__1	Of course that is why you shut down all meetings!
__label__1	I know when I go dancing, I really want to be wearing a bulky harness with a large weight of metal on one side of my body.
__label__-1	Is climate change real?
__label__-1	so i won't read it, i'll spend my time on net neutrality and privacy issues.
__label__1	more jobs for real americans
__label__1	"""If you vote for me I will do things I should have been doing for over a year on the campaign trail"" ""She's the best candidate, so transparent, I'm with her"""
__label__1	"So he is part of the ""scam"" too I see"
__label__1	Having a private email server
__label__1	This doesn't sound biased at all.
__label__1	Looks like their meeting went well.
__label__-1	They're just trying to prove that any idiot can do it.
__label__-1	Not only that, they posted multiple articles tearing into Nate Silver for saying that Trump had a 33% chance of winning.
__label__1	yeah lets underpay people even more
__label__-1	He ain't wrong.
__label__1	"An ""article"" where the author's name goes curiously unlisted, and is submitted by someone with a username identical to the blog that the article is sourced from... Yeah, totally checks out"
__label__1	Will his fascist gun grabbing never end?
__label__-1	His approval rating is slowly climbing, but not all Democrats are big fans of him.
__label__1	"So its being reported by ""Info Wars"" so you know it must be true."
__label__-1	"Like ""Hope"" they get over being a bunch of crazy bastards?"
__label__1	"He can't loose, Alex said ""It's over for the globalists"""
__label__1	Just vote again!
__label__1	So proud of my home state.
__label__-1	I can't believe that some people say this sub has gone to shit.
__label__1	Trust Shite-Bart to report on the truly important issues.
__label__-1	Hookerpiss
__label__1	Well obviously being deaf is just an excuse to resist arrest.
__label__1	those repubs really like democracy don't they
__label__1	If only we had strict gun laws like Mexico - which bans basically everything - we could have a safe society.
__label__1	Good to see they are focused on the important issues.
__label__1	Luckily Trump is smarter than the generals.
__label__-1	Rick Perry had great hair and he's a fucking idiot.
__label__-1	Seems if one was a savvy business man he could easily counter this.
__label__1	Success!
__label__-1	They also said they can't confirm or deny that Hilary matched trumps donation dollar for dollar
__label__1	But this will be mitigated when Trump turns California red.
__label__-1	OMG THEY SCRIPTED INTRODUCTIONS...... Doesn't everyone do that?
__label__-1	They should've just sent it to April Ryan and she could have arranged the meeting for Trump
__label__-1	"Aren't they ones always going on about the ""Nanny State""?"
__label__-1	the guy who said his tax plan is going to be a tax hike for the wealthy, but instead is actually the largest tax cut for the wealthy in history.
__label__1	But they're all without sin so it's cool.
__label__1	But the stock market!
__label__1	Fake news.
__label__1	"Nice to see that ""emergency meeting"" with the RNC heads mellowed Donald so much"
__label__1	It's okay since he shows hatred towards Trump.
__label__1	Some say Politifact supported Hillary Clinton, but that's a conspiracy theory too.
__label__1	Yeah, but he couldn't push it over the arbitrary 20k mark - THAT was all Trump.
__label__-1	except he won't be an ambassador
__label__-1	"There's those ""entitlements."""
__label__-1	Because it's a secret code sign about the pizza parlor on the moon where they are hiding the kids to be molested and then turned into pizza.
__label__-1	Something Hillary can't do in her party without the super delegates.
__label__1	trump totally cares about these people!
__label__1	After all, if they are not hiding something, what do they have to fear?
__label__1	They should visit Russia, it might help them appreciate how great Putin is doing.
__label__1	I saw at least 1 black guy in that picture idk what you guys are all upset about
__label__-1	syria... libya... ukraine... yemen... thanks obama!
__label__1	Didn't you guys know it's just her turn to be president?
__label__-1	There is a part of his base that I'm POSITIVE wouldn't bat an eye at that.
__label__-1	That's been clear since the 80's, if you were paying attention.
__label__1	ALL THANKS TO OUR GLORIOUS LEADER, DONALD TRUMP!
__label__1	You mean SOCIALIST nations
__label__1	Yes, and when Trump loses by one vote you can thank Jesus.
__label__1	I saw Trumps face, he seemed REALLY excited to have her support.
__label__-1	I wouldn't mind them changing Obamacare if they would *actually give a plan on what to do*
__label__1	What is the worst that could happen?
__label__1	Yeah, but what about HER emails?
__label__1	This isn't his skin being thin this is him showing he has power!
__label__-1	"Spicer has stated during the Daily Press Brief that Trump was ""free at the time"" of the tweet."
__label__1	Yeah, I trust her national security policy.
__label__1	Yes, just like anybody who thinks that random warmongering in the middle east might be a bad idea must be an ISIS sympathizer.
__label__-1	The wealthiest Americans have all the political representation but none of the taxation.
__label__1	I am sure his plans are nuanced and well-thought out.
__label__-1	Trump on white terror is the dad who's half-heartedly lecturing his son on not getting into fights at school, but will wink and slip him five dollars the moment the wife stops glaring at him and turns around.
__label__1	All we need to do is further privatize education and the free market will sort all of our problems out.
__label__-1	"""Protesters plan on wasting their weekend standing outside a gate """
__label__-1	Scott Walker STFU, please
__label__-1	Is that the excuse Mary Jesus' mother pulled?
__label__1	No guns?
__label__-1	We should test Christians and if they don't believe in evolution or science deport them.
__label__1	"That just cost Rand Paul any chance of winning the presidency; he's been ""tainted"" by Obama."
__label__-1	Donald Trump is insane and needs to be impeached.
__label__-1	In other news: the Pope is Catholic, bears shit in the woods, and the sky is blue.
__label__-1	Isn't this old news, or have I misunderstood something?
__label__1	Good to see they learned the lesson of that dark time in American history.
__label__1	Yea because that's one area that could use some cost cutting measures to increase profitability.
__label__1	Just because they behead people doesn't make them a bad person.
__label__-1	Based on the meltdowns and hyperbole in this thread by the libs, he sounds like he's the right guy.
__label__1	Fucking plebs with jobs wanting to vote.
__label__1	He knows more than those giving the briefings, so why bother.
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__1	Why oh why can't we return to the halcyon economy of 2008 before Obama became president?
__label__-1	Mental children using children to rationalize their argument.
__label__-1	Climate change is the only threat that is occurring right now on our soil, with the potential for irreversible damage.
__label__1	Sorry California, you shouldn't even bother turning up to vote, your vote won't count because we have already coronated our queen Hillary
__label__1	Serves him right for not dying and wasting the court's time.
__label__1	Damn liberal media.
__label__1	The missing 12% doesn't know what impeach means.
__label__-1	The judicial branch wasn't involved in this.
__label__-1	I don't watch Fox, or care for them, but a friend informed me of this and I thought you might find it interesting.
__label__-1	in his first 2 yrs in office, obama dropped 25,000 bombs, most of any president.
__label__-1	So predictable that it hurts.
__label__-1	While I don't condone violence you don't have full 1st amendment rights to do whatever at a private event you are trying to crash.
__label__1	I guess no one saw hat one coming.
__label__1	She has a way with words.
__label__-1	Thanks, Tea Party!
__label__-1	Well it worked for Paris, I'm sure I'll work for us
__label__-1	I mean it could have been he wanted to play some grand theft auto
__label__-1	Republicans: The biggest **Death Panel** you ever saw.
__label__1	They're just trying to put money back in Americans' pockets by slashing the federal government's enormous voicemail bill
__label__1	The Republican party has announced plans to annihilate two major marine sanctuaries and replace them with oil fields that dump their contents straight into the ocean!
__label__1	Scott the Engineer is the only one on the show that understands politics!
__label__-1	I don't think any one country can save us, I think it would have to be combined effort of the intelligence agencies of the West.
__label__1	LOCK HIM UP!
__label__1	WSJ- the cutting edge of politcal insight
__label__1	Just take a look at all the blood in Colorado

__label__1	You really pissed President Bannon off didn't you Donnie?
__label__-1	And I would be ok with that.
__label__-1	That should tell Americans something.
__label__-1	Happy to oblige, actually.
__label__-1	Who?
__label__1	"""Think of the *taxpayers*!"""
__label__-1	Mmm, mush.
__label__-1	Compared to 'anchor baby enabler' or 'anchor baby apologist' or 'anchor baby promoter' or 'anchor baby parent,' 'anchor baby' is hardly derogatory at all.
__label__1	Well it was okay to gun him down then!
__label__-1	I don't even pay attention to Clinton anymore.
__label__-1	Nancy Pelosi is out of touch with reality.
__label__-1	Fuck this Hillary wasn't going to win anyway the Midwest made its mind up long before comey's announcement.
__label__1	Yea, BIG FUCKING SURPRISE!
__label__1	Heil Trump
__label__1	But -- but there are 970k doctors in the US, the rest must prefer Trump's approach.
__label__1	SMH Obama'll do anything to get us in his FEMA camps
__label__-1	"The technical term is ""twirl."""
__label__-1	Fox is wasting their time...this shitty administration, much like it's predecessors, is quite capable of undermining itself.
__label__1	Because all the men were busy scooping the driveway?
__label__1	If Trump signed a pledge, then it must be true and he'll follow through if elected.
__label__-1	They could shorten that title by a few words and still be on point.
__label__1	Wikileaks (largely staffed by non-US citizens) totally isn't taking sides in the election and trying to influence it.
__label__1	Yes, that's the exact and only reason.
__label__-1	So I guess we are already going to forget that Sanders was blackmailed and had no real chance of winning now.
__label__-1	When you're ~~a star~~ rich they let you do it.
__label__-1	"Literally was going to post ""4 more years!"""
__label__1	Just don't expect to see a doctor for it.
__label__1	Yeah, 17 US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russians are behind the DNC hacks because the Democrats want to delegitimization Trump.
__label__1	So much for the Tolerant Right
__label__1	Lock up all the pizzas!
__label__-1	Plz be right
__label__1	Good idea, Donald.
__label__-1	List the technologies, products and services that are sole creations by china that will make it dominant.
__label__-1	Wait, were there cars before guns?
__label__1	When all else fails blame Pepe
__label__-1	Clearly, those are alternative laws.
__label__1	I love this new GOP minority outreach program.
__label__1	Thanks for the confirmation.
__label__1	The patriots are the ones who receive money from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc to their foundation.
__label__-1	inb4 boycott steam
__label__1	You're not supposed to accept handouts you communist fuck.
__label__1	So are churches and parliament buildings, no use really
__label__-1	Maybe Clinton should have paid her female staff as a 1:1 ratio compared to males.
__label__1	But think of all of the jobs they could create with that savings!
__label__1	I can't possibly imagine why Americans don't want another Bush in the White House.
__label__-1	Where are the Kanye 2020 people now?
__label__1	Paul Ryan, the man of principle.
__label__1	Oh but Massachusetts is just another state that borders Vermont.
__label__1	Damn that democracy idea making the unwashed masses think they can influence our plutocracy!
__label__1	But hey Hillary was going to start WW3
__label__-1	What are the odds that its not the 7s, 8s, 9s and 10s on the attractive skill getting harassed.
__label__-1	Is he related to Herbert or Dubya?
__label__-1	I can't believe Politifact has to fact-check things like that :/
__label__-1	Mitt: I am not cutting taxes so people will have more money.
__label__1	If Stein can be charged with a misdemeanor she clearly doesn't have the connections necessary to be President of the United States.
__label__-1	Ohhhhhh shit.
__label__1	He was a loser, he successfully launched 0 nukes during his entire tenure, overrated!
__label__1	This is functionally equivalent to sucker punching a guy who's actively leaving an event in the face.
__label__1	But I thought he knew more than the generals.
__label__-1	So many campaign promises left by the roadside as soon as Trump realized some actual effort would be needed to even partially fulfill them.
__label__1	not in the constitution, doesn't matter
__label__1	NewsMax....a bastion of objective journalism!
__label__1	And they do so because they have nothing else to do, especially since the darker skinned ones are pretty lazy
__label__-1	hashtagstealfromliberals
__label__1	Of course Glenn does, where else is he going to score all that ~~cocaine~~ outrage fuel?
__label__1	Strom Thurmond had a black kid, so he can't be racist!
__label__-1	The polls don't close for hours, genius.
__label__1	Yeah, it's MUCH better to have your healthcare in the hands of an insurance company, where their sole goal is to maximize shareholder profits.
__label__1	A win for the working man!
__label__1	Well there's a surprise.
__label__-1	Indeed, the free market will ensure that only those who deserve to die do so.
__label__1	Clearly the superior option
__label__1	I can't believe someone would disrespect all the victims of the Bowling Green Massacre!
__label__-1	Wow typical leftist garbage!
__label__1	Why this is impossible, Republicans only have sex within a hetro-sexual marriage, and only when they want children.
__label__1	Will it still produce chem trails?
__label__1	Come on, the poor man can't survive on $1 salary!
__label__-1	If America had laws like civilized nations how would they pay for all those tanks?
__label__1	He's definitely going to lose now
__label__-1	Trump needs to go, by force if necessary.
__label__-1	Well if I was on meth, I would also think I can fly if I jump out the window.
__label__1	Yeah, but it creates a ton of jobs.
__label__1	Obama and his evil personal agenda to run America into the ground.
__label__-1	Oh... its CNN guys, nothing to see here.
__label__-1	No, no, no...**Nixon** was president then, so it was different.
__label__-1	I'd take a president who is constitutionally ineligible for office than a president who is constitutionally incapable of executing the duties of the office.
__label__-1	The less those idiots do, the better.
__label__1	yeah, but he's such a strong leader though
__label__1	It's very believable that people who donate money are the ones being turned down.
__label__-1	GOP rep: Can guarantee that many will lose insurance under GOP plan
__label__-1	funny thing, advantaged kids can read good cuz of all that lawyer talk their rich parents make them learn; while poor children are good at math cause they starve if they arent.
__label__1	He doesn't seem liberal enough.
__label__-1	We named the dog Indiana.
__label__-1	Which is against the law!
__label__-1	"I don't think that instituting mandatory background checks qualifies as ""overreaching""."
__label__1	Maybe this one will make america great again!
__label__-1	i wonder how long it'll take for nothing to happen
__label__-1	Well this is certainly the *most entertaining* result.
__label__1	If there is one thing we can all trust Clinton to do, it's uphold the law in a fair and just manner.
__label__-1	20 dead kindergartners didn't sway anyone, why would this?
__label__-1	Shame she couldn't show up for any debates with someone else earlier this year... Don't forget to vote for the Senate seats in November, too!
__label__1	Look at all Ted's fans jumping on this thread defending him, Trump's fans could learn something from this.
__label__1	Especially shitty in 1969 when we decided to leave the planet behind.
__label__-1	Radical Trumpist Terrorist
__label__-1	Fucking finally
__label__-1	What's the difference between fortune 100 and 500?
__label__-1	If Ailes had his way, I feel like she'd probably have been showered in something else.
__label__-1	Holy mother of god, the comments in this thread are making it extremely difficult to defend my generation.
__label__-1	So for all of his socialistic posturing, he shows exactly how much he cares about the American worker.
__label__-1	Wouldn't a pipeline be a greener alternative to rail and semi-trucks?
__label__-1	He probably owns investments in the private prison industry.
__label__1	My, how they hate big government interfering in their affairs!
__label__-1	This shit is how the Punisher gets created.
__label__1	Just look for a tweet that doesn't have a large vocabul .. vocab... vocabu... somebody who doesn't use big words
__label__-1	It's not uncommon for a politician to put forth a bill that he knows has absolutely no chance of actually becoming a law, to be able to pander to his very specific demographic who actually might be interested in that bill becoming a law.
__label__1	Like negative 1 million is bad right?
__label__1	I can't wait for this level of micromanaging in my life!
__label__1	Meaningless until he stops personally constructing FEMA death camps by hand
__label__-1	Simply common sense gun legislation that should be approved by anyone with even half a brain.
__label__-1	Because emails and economic anxiety, bro
__label__-1	Yes please, sue the baby
__label__1	"""Anti-virus software was turned off after Clinton and aide Huma Adebin experienced problems sending emails"" Obviously the first thing you try in the troubleshooting process."
__label__1	But Hilary's emails!
__label__-1	If you say it cause it's popular it's pandering, if you say it cause you have been saying it all along and it's actually your position AND it's popular is it still pandering or are you just true honest populist?
__label__1	I am sure it was Hillary personally who told them to dump shit in the sewer, not some rented driver who didn't care.
__label__1	no fear mongering here... just some honest, unbiased journalism
__label__1	He surely is draining the swamp with his picks.
__label__1	The general election has never been rigged before, absolutely never
__label__1	I am thoroughly disappointed in trump.
__label__-1	I feel like people are using trade as a scapegoat for the major changes that automation has brought (and will continue to bring) in the future.
__label__1	On the one hand, it would be a socialist country that is pacifist and anti-corporatist which makes it an easy target for the CIA, on the other hand Bernie's a jew and we all know how much Hillary loves Israel
__label__-1	It must suck to be a Republican in 2015, in fact the last 20 years or so must have been tough for any moderate GOP.
__label__-1	Effective politics requires maturity and patience.
__label__1	Well close enough
__label__-1	"When will they discover they don't ""drive around in Escalades while I have to work every day!"""
__label__-1	They should never have let hipsters be electors.
__label__-1	If the rolls were reversed, trump would be suing Obama by now.
__label__-1	Didn't mention 32 trillion in offshore money being brought back into the economy and taxed when the loopholes are close.
__label__1	I guess those evangelicals must have been without sin, casting the first stones and all.
__label__-1	Here in our berg the RINO's spouted the mantra questioning our motives, intellegence and conclusions if we dared stand against it.
__label__1	Uh, he already knows more than the generals, so there's really nothing to learn.
__label__-1	Remember, you may think both candidates are idiots but whoever is the next president is going to be making appointments to the Supreme Court.
__label__1	But hey, cutting taxes should fix this right?
__label__1	Oh that money doesn't bias her in any way though.
__label__-1	The socialist scientist cabal detonated the pipeline to promote their Global Hoax.
__label__-1	And cut taxes for the richest amongst us.
__label__-1	Progress is not equal to bending the knee to Hillary you fascist.
__label__1	Because marijuana was nonexistent in Idaho before it became legal in neighboring states.
__label__1	....right that almost the same thing
__label__1	Let's start an online petition, then they have to listen to us right
__label__1	Jeb can fix it!
__label__1	Yeah, because that's really an emergency.
__label__1	In the comments, duhhhh
__label__-1	Thanks Obama!
__label__-1	If you actually get off your arse (actually you don't even have to do that) and check the website yourself it's 100% obvious it's a republican run site, it even says in big bold lettters help us stop x from getting to congress.
__label__1	Capitalism FTW
__label__-1	"I would hardly call this action ""a series of executive branch actions"" unless there are others that you did not mention or link to."
__label__-1	I smell bankruptcy in the wind.
__label__-1	HHaha yes
__label__1	Totally not a fascist guys omg Godwin's law or some bullshit
__label__-1	A couple congressional election cycles after he declares voting day a national holiday will quickly get him a congress in line with his policies.
__label__-1	Tell us more, O Role Model for Abstinence.
__label__-1	Well if McMullin says it it must be true
__label__1	They should have went to college so they could get better jobs.
__label__-1	"""Shoot first, ask questions later' seems to be paying off for them."
__label__1	Them damn liberals need to quit regulating my trans-fat blood levels!
__label__-1	Gold
__label__1	If only he would stop being racist towards that poor black woman...
__label__1	Sure, yeah protest all you want right just do it over there in the back where nobody can see you.
__label__1	Yet the military is woefully underfunded and we need to increase spending.
__label__1	But, but socailism!
__label__1	Well, it certainly is a good thing that Global Warming is a hoax, then huh?
__label__1	All guys do it.
__label__1	well this is clearly the fault of black people and their racism
__label__-1	Gives me the feels I haven't felt since... well Barack Obama first ran for President.
__label__-1	The KKK is a Christian organization.
__label__1	Only after Hillary releases her transcripts!
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__1	I feel so sorry for her.
__label__-1	Wake up sheeple!
__label__-1	Mmmmm... What she said was that her mom had a choice and that it was wonderful she chose to have her.
__label__-1	Nothing fascist here, nope.
__label__-1	I'm sure the Donald at least reviewed their head shots to make sure they look the part.
__label__-1	Political season can't take anything literally.
__label__1	Finally - some job creation; someone's gotta build those camps.
__label__-1	"Will he invoke ""Christian Values"" over in Israel?"
__label__-1	My father recently posted something copied from some random conservative news site about how if we don't increase spending on the military then the bad terrorist immigrants will come in and destroy all of our art and humanities so what's the point of funding something that's gonna die?
__label__1	shocking!
__label__-1	Paul Ryan probably gets off every night to the idea of eliminating Medicare, what a huge piece of shit.
__label__-1	The anti-abortion bill itself is among the things that make the GOP look bad.
__label__1	He did it because Jews weren't the only ones involved in the holocaust, he's a president for all, guys
__label__-1	She reminds me of Sterling Archer's mom.
__label__1	JOBS JOBS JOBS
__label__-1	Take it easy Schiff, I can't keep getting boners at dinner like this.
__label__1	To be fair these people don't deserve anything, it's really their fault for moving in to Exxon's area of operations before Exxon got there.
__label__-1	Is he wearing a doo-rag?
__label__1	Obviously, the Economist is a liberal rag.
__label__1	You spelled ACORN wrong.
__label__1	Makes sense that they're going to need so many buses when none of the backs will be full
__label__1	Politician claims to speak for God, seems legit
__label__-1	fair or not?
__label__-1	America's dad.
__label__1	"""emphatically denied that he was in contact with Russians known to US intelligence"" Where did I hear that before... Totally not from Flyn, right?"
__label__1	Of course supporting ALEC is fine and certainly uncontroversial.
__label__-1	And all of those people will just claim none of it happened because of their vigilance.
__label__-1	Priority landing based on how much you pay...what could go wrong?
__label__-1	What is up with the flag burning?
__label__1	Santorum - you got some on 'ya!
__label__1	The FBI is the enemy of the American people.
__label__-1	He does want nukes
__label__-1	I thought that the first didn't end too well.
__label__-1	How does one even going about becoming an elector?
__label__-1	Misleading title is misleading.
__label__-1	I can just picture Ollie from family guy doing their weather report.
__label__-1	Over what?
__label__-1	Aw sweet, the results will be rolling in, any minute now!
__label__-1	Aha, so this isn't about Obamacare being unprofitable, it's for retaliation because they aren't being allowed to form a health insurance monopoly.
__label__1	He's got the best people, doesn't he folks.
__label__1	Hey - the Founding Fathers did not specify Facebook or Twitter in the Constitution so its fair game
__label__-1	I think this can't help to their.
__label__-1	That's my state!
__label__1	Sieg heil!
__label__-1	"Right wing police state sycophants who complain about ""big gubment"" what say you?"
__label__1	"because the people who are asking us ""common folk"" to do this really consider the moral consequence of their actions"
__label__-1	Fuck yes.
__label__1	TIL the GOP is a branch of government comparable to the POTUS.
__label__-1	We'd better get Assange working then
__label__-1	This is what happens when you get your international relations degree from Trump University.
__label__-1	Trump has always been more corrupt than Clinton, I'll be so happy when he screws over the people who voted for him.
__label__1	I don't know if I would be happy associating with Spike Lee after what he did to NBA2K.
__label__-1	Found the asshole.
__label__-1	Blaming your poor product on higher expenses is not a way to run a business.
__label__-1	The OIG said otherwise and I don't think the FBI is going to let her have the last word on the issue.
__label__-1	I would say what I really feel about Jim DeMint but I like being able to fly on airplanes.
__label__-1	I would cheat with her too.
__label__1	Alternative truths!
__label__1	I'm sure it will work *next* time.
__label__1	inb4 playing the woman card
__label__-1	Better do what he says.
__label__1	And I'm sure Clear Channel's decision to shut down the only liberal/progressive talk radio station in the Portland metropolitan area (Oregon) a week after the November election so they could open a third sports station shows absolutely no media bias either!
__label__1	Brainwash the sheep
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__-1	Bernie sanders to cosponsor free free stuff to the lazy and unmotivated
__label__1	Yeah, we definitely don't live in an oligarchy
__label__-1	Kasich = Koch Puppet
__label__1	Her voice reminded me of my mother in law and I'm sure other country's leaders would agree!
__label__1	It's totally ok, though, because 1 trillion will flow to the 99% and 11 trillion will flow to the 1% so they can create jobs!
__label__-1	Gotta abort the poor
__label__-1	As long as we aren't exaggerating.
__label__-1	Syrian refugee acceptance into US 99.9% Muslim 0.1% Christian Syrian population 90% Muslim 10% Christian that's a 100:1 degree of discrimination for you progressives keeping track at home.
__label__-1	She was most likely joking.
__label__1	"""Your poll does not suit my world view so I will dismiss it."""
__label__-1	headline ripped from a message board in 2008
__label__-1	Damn, I saw this up to 11 up votes and the back down to 0 in one refresh
__label__-1	Well what about those coming in from the countries the DONT like them?
__label__1	Probably why they seem to have a firm grasp on how the world works
__label__1	Aww, my heart goes out to those poor NSA workers.
__label__1	Clinton is a woman therefore anyone that disagrees with her is a misogynist.
__label__1	It's wonderful to see the caring, open-minded, tolerant left here on Reddit.
__label__1	I'm sure *this* will sink Hillary
__label__1	But why didn't she come forward sooner?
__label__1	We need more businessmen in government to fight for the working class, right Trump voters?
__label__-1	Why not just do a straight party ballot if you're not going to look at the other candidates?
__label__1	The lack of evidence is clear evidence that she and Barry covered it up, obviously.
__label__1	This is so next time Obama leaves the country Trump won't let him back in.
__label__1	Gotta get that last Black History Month celebration in before the month is over
__label__-1	That's not at all what he said, OP.
__label__-1	and?
__label__1	I'm confident that had it been illegal to own a gun, this guy would have totally not committed 9 murders.
__label__1	"""You think our country is so innocent?"""
__label__-1	Republicans have a huge supporter in this effort, young people and minorities, who tend not to vote in midterms even when Republicans aren't trying to block them.
__label__-1	That media player gave my computer cancer, fuck you EW.
__label__-1	Florida is a state that values their retarded principles over common sense.
__label__1	And putting out tax records showing earned income from Goldman was such evil.
__label__-1	Why is Tiger Woods doing this?
__label__1	WTF I love TSA now.
__label__1	Thank God for that peaceful transfer of power Obama was so intent upon.
__label__1	I'm surprised he's not an expert on the military considering his proud history of military service to our great country.
__label__-1	I did not serve so I can see shit like this.
__label__1	I'm sure she just a Berniebro in disguise.
__label__1	did Trump just realize that there is something he owns that would lose lots of money if the steady stream of illegal labor dried up?
__label__1	And Spicer is an outstanding press secretary
__label__-1	Well, from behind, her and Trump have the same hair?
__label__1	Wow, he never cared about protecting the sick, imagine that, I'm absolutely shocked.
__label__1	He never said that
__label__-1	You know I think that recent You're the Worst episode did a good job with PTSD, Trump should check that out.
__label__1	Your facts and science have no place here.
__label__-1	Trump's not doing anything to put those puppet allegations to rest.
__label__1	Because the Kansas economy is doing so well.
__label__1	This is not the republicans fault - it the democrats/poor black people/democrats posing as republicans/republicans who aren't conservative enough/panda bears fault.
__label__1	What a surprise!
__label__-1	We need to make this a 'in your face' election issue.
__label__1	Well it's hard to argue with that logic.
__label__-1	It will continue to fall, but she will still get the nomination due to name recognition.
__label__1	You mean President Bannon right?
__label__-1	Seems like this was all a grand plan to me.
__label__-1	Barely able to make this comment after being knocked out of my chair in shock.
__label__-1	Weaponized natural resources... I smell GOP money.
__label__-1	cops like this needs life in prison
__label__-1	B-b-b-but mah freeze peach?
__label__-1	Again, not really what she said.
__label__1	Right, because Democrats are known for viewing things from every conceivable perspective...
__label__1	"At least ""0"" is a nice round number."
__label__1	That was 50 years ago, maybe they've changed their 'minds'.
__label__1	And she killed Vince Foster, in the library, with the candlestick, too.
__label__-1	Blythe Danner, best known as a mommy.
__label__-1	Of course there won't be any conflict... so long as you only want to own the types of guns they approve of, with the kinds of magazines that they approve of and bought from the people they approve of, all of which is subject to them changing their mind.
__label__1	No way THAT will be abused
__label__1	Yeah we need new &amp; better journalism.. unless you disagree with my opinions then it's just the MSM being corrupt
__label__1	Certain minorities will get these license plates next because they disproportionately run red lights and it's not fair.
__label__1	Someone to have a beer with?
__label__-1	Any bets on when pets will be considered biological parents in that God forsaken state?
__label__1	But it's unfair to compare Trump to Hitler because some people use hyperbole!
__label__-1	I'm not sure Obama is making a political calculation about who to support
__label__-1	I say small government should start with him.
__label__1	and still we had a crises...clearly it is working
__label__1	That will really help him.
__label__-1	But that article is misleading a tax break is not the same thing as a tax handout.
__label__-1	He also says the voices in his head told him to join ISIS.
__label__1	"""Why should they pay more, they 'worked' hard for their money!"""
__label__-1	Lock him up.
__label__-1	to be fair, he actually said windfall taxes were un-american, not subsidies
__label__1	I think we need an updated Benghazi investigation too while we're at it
__label__1	What a fucking great strategy.
__label__-1	Israel is the real threat to peace.
__label__1	I thought he was the left side.
__label__-1	I feel like I'm slowly watching the erosion of our country and democracy.
__label__1	and what's more American than Big Tobacco and Billionaires ?
__label__-1	This headline is misleading
__label__1	Way to get taken for a ride by known liberal hacks Pew Research guys!
__label__1	I heard he has 8th stage super-multiple-parkinsons-sclerosis
__label__1	But those young'uns don't bother voting!
__label__-1	Trump knows how to pick 'em!
__label__1	If it's anything like his falsified doctors note we're in for a treat
__label__1	American Thinker, fair and impartial.
__label__1	He's a fake black
__label__1	Who stashed the pod under Sarah's bed?
__label__1	wtf I hate women now
__label__1	Well he was in the navy 50 years ago, he knows so much about security because of this.
__label__1	Who knew Pelosi was such misogynistic bigot, how dare she stand against women!
__label__1	Because CEOs hire better lawyers, duh.
__label__1	First those liberal shills are trying to take our rights, now they're trying to take our football!
__label__-1	Next, President Bannon is going to ban (native) people from America
__label__1	This can only mean the political conservatives will have to jump out of bed with the Roman Catholics if they intend to pursue their genetic manipulated human drones.
__label__-1	If true, this is at least a step in the right direction.
__label__1	Hillary is so far ahead she's shilling her books in campaign ads
__label__-1	The opposite goes for democrats.
__label__-1	Just like you're not paying attention to what he actually said?
__label__1	I would have gone with indefinite detention or torture, but I guess welfare is pretty bad too.
__label__-1	Jeffrey Epstein.
__label__-1	"I've always felt that more people than would admit, when it comes down to it, actually support it, but are afraid to speak out because of the false equivalency of ""it's murder""."
__label__-1	Or an Iranian throwing his shoe at an American president.
__label__1	The Russians have no business manipulating our elections, the DNC should be the only people allowed to subvert our democracy!
__label__-1	By removing DBE favors from government entities like restaurants at airports, for example.
__label__-1	I can't believe that he still tried to push it after it was proved an autistic shitpost by a 4chan anon.
__label__1	It's okay though she has a rocky past so we can attack her guilt free!
__label__1	But we have to unscrew the polls to know whats really going on.
__label__1	But Trump won the Nevada primary by a lot!
__label__-1	Maybe he'll give his tapes to Bebe Rebozo
__label__-1	Im sure it would be jaw-dropping if there were any *proof* of electoral corruption.
__label__-1	In other news, apples 40 times more popular than oranges.
__label__-1	Of all the Batman villains that could assume power in the real world, I definitely didn't expect The Penguin.
__label__1	H-E-R-O
__label__-1	He did...just smaller ones.
__label__-1	It's a good thing we saved ourselves from the secret republican, Hillary Clinton!
__label__1	Heh ... who would've guessed something like this would happen?
__label__1	If that only included Republicans like Hastert, the conservatives would jump on it.
__label__1	Rush Limbaugh disagrees therefore this inquiry must have a liberal bias
__label__-1	He'd be a Bernie Sanders Independent who caucused with Democrats.
__label__-1	Reminder that Mormons make up a small minority of California voters, while blacks voted overwhelmingly in support of Proposition 8.
__label__1	And 9-11 was an inside job.
__label__-1	Well if your love one loses coverage and dies, you know who to go after
__label__-1	At this point not really.
__label__-1	Another nail in our coffin
__label__-1	Dude don't ask US, ask HIM
__label__1	This article is full of evidence.
__label__1	Ron Paul is really the only guy that can admit our government could be in bed with the military industrial complex.

__label__1	Typical socialists
__label__1	Huh, treating people with respect makes them not hate you, who woulda thought?
__label__1	Well, with his broad background and deep experience in European affairs, I'm sure Donald's opinion carries significant weight with knowledgeable decision makers.

__label__-1	Ted Cruz is married to a Vice President of Goldman Sachs
__label__-1	Blame republicans except people from both party are critical of it, including candidate Obama.
__label__1	But I thought there was no difference between Democrats and Republicans?

__label__1	Well, She has my vote now.
__label__-1	It's from Brietbart, a subsidized arm of the right wing.
__label__1	As long as it keeps the right people from voting.
__label__1	Yeah people working their entire life an earning a retirement payout that is literally their money is totally going to be the end of our civilized society
__label__1	**ALLEN WEST** Well since he said it I must take it seriously
__label__-1	How about we start by GUTTING CONGRESSIONAL SALARIES AND BENEFITS?
__label__-1	Which means she's running for president.
__label__-1	But there is so much less to talk about that way.
__label__1	As tragic as the McCann case is, it's nowhere near satanic enough for Podesta to be involved.
__label__1	talks or new instructions?
__label__-1	DeVos
__label__-1	When you have a president-elect who routinely praises Vladimir Putin, talks about lifting Russian sanctions, signals a willingness to recognize the Crimean referendum, and suggests abandoning NATO countries who don't meet defence spending quotas, it's going to raise some eyebrows.
__label__1	About 100k more Or until a black police officer exerts force on a white upper middle class citizen.
__label__-1	But what does Tiffany think?
__label__1	Great job of uniting the country, Donald
__label__1	Wow such a profound statement.
__label__-1	Oh they'll be back supporting him with his SC pick because they are so pro-life, dontcha know.
__label__1	If they wanted to vote they should have taken the day off work and went sooner.
__label__1	Too bad our court system doesn't poll the general public to arrive at verdicts.
__label__-1	Well, slap another 30 or so delegates into her column.
__label__-1	Said a nutjob.
__label__-1	Will this be one of the biggest landslides in history?
__label__-1	How could someone (secret service or not) just idly use their key to turn off an elevator then not know what happened?
__label__1	I'm so glad the anti-establishment candidate is putting the establishment in power
__label__1	I'm sure it's going to help bring in the customers.
__label__-1	"I really liked the last line: ""Bannon is like if the tire mud flap with the giant-breasted silhouette got a library card."""
__label__-1	I've sat next to my wife on a plane
__label__-1	Yeah, because that was the only issue with the ban.
__label__-1	"""Don't worry, he won't touch Social Security or Medicare, it's just 4d chess"""
__label__1	That's because they're lazy
__label__1	But he's not taking a wage
__label__1	Don't you guys know he's a goober like kasich?
__label__1	So this is what a fair trial looks like
__label__1	Yes, the lifelong New York liberal is going all in to ban abortion.
__label__1	Well, it's not like Clapper has lied about wiretapping before.
__label__-1	Sounds we like we have too many goddamn laws.
__label__-1	Bizarrely enough, they seem to prefer someone who's been in the situation room monitoring covert ops.
__label__1	He is definitely going to win now!
__label__-1	Money saved goes straight into billionaires' pocket via tax cuts.
__label__-1	LMAO voter fraud allegation predictions were right on the money.
__label__1	Damn those journalists and their absolute obsession with reporting every story they come across!
__label__1	Good old unbiased journalism.
__label__-1	Trump is a mess.
__label__1	Guys there's still a chance Bernie can win!
__label__-1	Free shit!
__label__-1	Because that'll kill all the birds duh
__label__-1	Use of the term sheeple disqualifies you from being taken seriously
__label__1	Maybe Sean Hannity will put in a good word for him?
__label__1	Obviously he's a terrorist.
__label__1	Ahh from a very reputable and intelligent source I see.
__label__-1	The media breathes a heavy sigh of relief and gives themselves a pat on the back for a job well done.
__label__-1	thats not what the GOP says
__label__-1	Did Trump watch her pee too?
__label__1	But he's black so one executive order equals 3 or 5!
__label__-1	I can't wait for round two of leaks, the DNC is a *mess*.
__label__-1	Romney may get the last laugh when donald gets impeached and declares bankrupt.
__label__-1	Interesting that the court ruling won't stop him, since he's just going to individually sign each one now
__label__-1	*after* they dropped the lawsuits
__label__1	Fraud in government contracts, shocked, shocked I tell you!
__label__-1	It's not his fault, Abuela made him, she is very muscular.
__label__1	I'm sure the Secret Service is *delighted* by this election.
__label__1	Yeah, that'll pass.
__label__-1	That isn't that many people.
__label__-1	Force them to wear a fitbit and monitor it?
__label__1	Please tell us all the sage wisdom you've learned in the last two years, o wise and experienced one.
__label__-1	The Onion is fake news!
__label__1	I don't see this being abused at all
__label__1	So long as they keep increasing executive salaries!
__label__-1	Gonna miss Obama... I hope he'll be more blatantly vocal once he's no longer Prez.
__label__1	Well I have to give it to Pence for being introspective for a change.
__label__-1	Again?
__label__1	But if you just pull your bootstraps you can get there too!
__label__1	He should fire all the Republicans cause the Dems want so
__label__-1	Fox News misinforms their viewers.
__label__1	If you stand up and embrace science, the future, and move out of the dark ages we will sue your ass into submission.
__label__-1	Well of course fracking poses a risk to drinking water... If fracking is so good why do they advertize how wonderful it is?
__label__-1	Probably because politicians figure giving tax breaks to big companies like this creates new jobs in the us, while simultaneously giving citizens cheaper gas; lol.
__label__1	he's to busy to listen to the lyrics though
__label__-1	Isn't Hillary bffs with a former grand wizard?
__label__-1	"I made up to ""today I had to share my thoughts..."""
__label__1	Walking-things-with-baby-makers are meant to make babies, not to speak.
__label__1	but shillary mailz!
__label__1	A political ad with misleading information but not technically lying Wow...never saw that before
__label__-1	Gaffe: when a politician accidentally tells the truth
__label__-1	Maybe Hillary should have cared about single-payer health care.
__label__1	It's because college educated white women are sexist bernie bros.
__label__-1	What a joke, the fact that he isn't leading by more than 66 points shows he's a horribly weak candidate.
__label__-1	"Can we stop calling them ""fiscal conservatives"" now?"
__label__1	Probably liberal volcanoes trying to help demon-crats stop good old 'Murikan industry from polluting.
__label__-1	if you live in new york don't leave home without your jew-star on your sleeve
__label__-1	"Flu can cause pneumonia, but if that is the case with Hillary, Bill should have said that because ""Clinton has pneumonia"" has been in the headlines for days."
__label__1	Yes, they're just shoving those pills into people's mouths.
__label__-1	How many of the 10 are Democratic electors?
__label__1	Of course not, they should have full unfettered access to our conversations
__label__1	Wow, I can't believe i ever voted for that guy.
__label__-1	"Well who the hell else are going to save us from Xenos, the thirsting gods of Chaos and the horrors from the dawn of time, sure as fuck isn't Tim Kaine and ""throw me in the van like a side of beef"" clinton."
__label__1	Wow that is so many!
__label__-1	Shouldn't he go to jail because of this ?
__label__1	Shouldn't the free market take care of the veterans?
__label__1	I love it when a link re sizes my browser window.
__label__-1	I thought this was common knowledge.
__label__-1	What an ignorant fucking #$%&amp;!
__label__-1	Part time jobs in place of full time jobs, highest income inequality ever, and lowest labor force participation rate...yeah that's not a recovery.
__label__1	"I heard it was *""potentially""* a ZILLION... and they *""may""* have contained the nuclear codes, Colonel Sanders secret recipe, and naked photos of Jesus!"
__label__1	Absolutely nothing to see here.
__label__1	It's good they're finally catching a break
__label__-1	That's very sexist of her.
__label__-1	So he's threatening us?
__label__-1	Sopranos - Weight Watchers = Chris Christie
__label__1	But Hillary helps treat AIDS patients, so they're about equal.
__label__1	That's working out for us bigly in Illinois.
__label__-1	there's a bright spot
__label__-1	trump isnt bringing freedom
__label__1	You found a child molester who is not a Republican!
__label__-1	What frightened lives they must lead.
__label__-1	Donald Trump is a business failure, and a human failure, whose single greatest, and perhaps only, talent is making others pay for his mistakes.
__label__1	I don't see what the problem is... the head of the DNC was only taking money from predatory payday loan companies.
__label__-1	And candy at every recess
__label__1	Might as well hang a picture of his penis, enlarged and from a certain perspective to show how yuge it is.
__label__1	Appointing more Buffalo Wild Wings managers?
__label__1	No, you just think that she's boring because of systemic sexism.
__label__-1	What was even in the emails other than politicians being politicians?
__label__-1	all it takes is a week of reading the local police blotter to know that.
__label__-1	Did anyone call Sean Hannity?
__label__-1	I think we should change the color of upvotes.
__label__1	No way I can't believe it, Bernie was telling the truth again?
__label__-1	God, this sub is desperate.
__label__1	How can they know it is fracking chemicals if the fracking chemical ingredients are trade secrets the companies aren't required to disclose?
__label__-1	Irony; redditors hate Hillary, and also hate women, but the enemy of your enemy, eh?
__label__1	But it feeeeeeels worse.
__label__-1	Said the same thing in 08 feel the Bern
__label__-1	Tom Harkin is huge in Iowa, this is the real deal
__label__-1	Down voting the truth dose't change whats happening.
__label__1	Easy, bing-watch 'West Wing' to get a crash course on how to run the White House
__label__-1	"And make sure to patrol polling places on the 28th, for the ""others""."
__label__-1	People who think like this make my head hurt.
__label__-1	Only one good choice and it'll put Hillary over the top-Tulsi Gabbard Not despite the fact that she endorsed Trump but because of it
__label__-1	Here we go again.
__label__1	The population is just tired of winning
__label__1	Good thing he has such a strong grasp of climate change, evolution, and how to deal with an active shooter
__label__1	The check is in the mail.
__label__1	Nothing proves Trump isn't in league with Putin like Trump informing Putin that Syria would be bombed before telling Congress
__label__1	I love article with lots of assertions and no links to other materials or quotes from actual people.
__label__-1	It's salty in here
__label__-1	How do electoral laws apply here?
__label__1	And don't forget, women bleed once a month and those poor male soldiers might mistake that for a real wound.
__label__-1	It's not like he'll need it for the general election.
__label__1	But bro, it's her turn!
__label__-1	This is the Hillary campaign starting to get extra dirty as she gets more and more desperate to stop losing voters.
__label__-1	If it's undocumented, how do you quantify it for a stat?
__label__-1	They don't really care about rigging elections otherwise they would go after Hillary and the DNC primaries scandal.
__label__1	Yeah but it's still her turn, so everyone needs to shut the fuck up.
__label__1	See, Trump really does get the best people.
__label__1	Nah, both parties are the same, voting is a sham, Ds and Rs are equally bad.
__label__1	I'm sure that will turn out well.
__label__1	Since everything else has failed to motivate these people maybe this will drive them to get good jobs so they can buy their own insurance.
__label__1	But trump likes the gays !
__label__-1	well duh
__label__1	Boy, I sure can't see anything going wrong with this, nope, nothing whatsoever.
__label__1	You forget Jeff sessions, party over country guys whoo
__label__-1	[Ignores stated reasons and suggests no reasons]
__label__-1	And Trump would still be losing.
__label__1	I'm glad he was on the Democratic platform committee then.
__label__-1	He's an idiot.
__label__-1	Nice small govt bruh!
__label__-1	Republicans were frustrated by the fillibuster, which ground to a halt the daily routine of voting to repeal Obamacare and circumventing Roe v. Wade.
__label__-1	Gee imagine that
__label__-1	And yet another lie from the person to become president.
__label__1	Yes, the time honored GOP tradition of helping already rich people become even richer at the expense of everyone else plays so well in minority neighborhoods, it's amazing that this sort of thing is even needed.
__label__1	I think the best course of action is to probably disarm everybody but the extremely wealthy and well connected.
__label__1	Well they have to cheat in order to prevent voter-fraud!
__label__-1	Lady gaga is an embarrassment
__label__-1	They both are the same.
__label__-1	It is remarkable how he continuously dissapoints me.
__label__-1	To those who think the market CAN regulate itself: Industrial Revolution.
__label__1	Yes, because in a complex economic downturn synonymous with capitalism, you can do nothing but blame literally .1% of people.
__label__1	So much winning coming from this administration!
__label__-1	Suddenly, millions of lonely gay men will visit their doctor for Viagra prescriptions!
__label__1	Yiannopoulos has not advocated pedophilia he was just ordering pizza using code words because media icons like him it is more acceptable to be shaggung 13 year olds than eating carbs
__label__-1	Member when they were bitching because Obama had too many Czars?
__label__1	So you're saying it's possible.
__label__-1	That outreach is going great!
__label__1	Right, because how could that go wrong?
__label__-1	Snowden should come home now.
__label__-1	I work and have worked in mental health in Kansas for the past 3 years AMA
__label__1	I'm sure she was there personally rejecting the reasonably priced alternatives.
__label__1	"""I haven't called Russia in 10 years, I e-mail them now"""
__label__-1	I'd really get a kick out of hearing what people ITT think will happen when the debt gets *too big...*
__label__1	all evidence has a clear liberal bias
__label__1	"oh you mean ""anyone part of the liberal establishment want to chime in?"""
__label__1	What need are their for petitions when we can have such great interactions with the tweeter in chief via twitter?
__label__-1	How much do you bet that the 9th Circuit will uphold the block on the ban next month?
__label__-1	Uh, you might want to check today's polls?
__label__1	ITT: Medical professionals.
__label__-1	Headline should read: Hillary won votes in the wrong places by greater margin in history
__label__1	Can't have weapons manufacturers' feelings getting damaged now can we?
__label__1	DEMOCRATS: ALPHA AS FUCK
__label__-1	Poor thing fell off the glass cliff again.
__label__1	But he's a rapist, that CIA plant lady who blogs about revenge said he was and everything!
__label__1	Well it's only fair, given how many times Obama barred Fox News from covering him.
__label__1	But, but, but, we have to RESPECT their views.
__label__-1	"You know, in other countries, the ""conservative"" side is really different."
__label__1	Good thing Sotomayor is a God fearing strong libertarian that wants to restore the constitution and bring back small government!
__label__1	Look at Trump creating jobs!
__label__-1	I'm ashamed this man came from my neighborhood.
__label__-1	Because a lot of people in positions of power like firearms and are worried about how the debate surrounding them would develop were we to have real data on their usage.
__label__1	Nothing like the clinton foundation
__label__-1	Only because it's on to the next attention-grabbing issue that's chosen to be front and center
__label__1	Good riddance to the big-government nanny-state historic site bureaucrats.
__label__-1	Get fucked, Alex.
__label__1	He got resigned because he let Trump win.
__label__-1	I'm just sitting here wondering how many Trumpettes will upvote/comment without reading the article.
__label__-1	Looks like we, the American people, will be paying for the wall after all!
__label__1	Surely this will make the United States more safe.
__label__1	I'm sure they're motivated by genuine concern and just want to do the right thing.
__label__-1	Hopefully his time behind bars is going to knock some sense in him.
__label__-1	There's not many ways to reword hard work in a speech like this.
__label__1	I'm sure that this will make it easier for people to get out of poverty
__label__-1	Exactly what America was founded on: religious discrimination.
__label__1	But he's not a woman!
__label__1	Yes you can!
__label__1	They should be out putting CROOKED HILLARY in jail instead of hamming it up with Trump.
__label__-1	"Just in time for the debate so they can lead every question with ""Bernie your losing by 33 points... What is your thoughts on..."""
__label__-1	9 states legalized it while he was president, and he let them.
__label__-1	Well that's what you get when you support a fucking fascist just because you think he'll give you a tax break, bitch.
__label__-1	I like how he praises the idea of executing people without any regard for their 'rights' How the hell can any Constitutionalist support this guy
__label__1	Why would Trump side with America?
__label__1	It's amazing a completely non-partisan group like WikiLeaks still hasn't been able to find these.
__label__1	Hey, it's not like he disputed those very allegations on camera in a debate a few weeks before the election or anything
__label__1	Yeah, the status quo sure is inspiring :')
__label__1	But, we can't cut subsidies to Big Oil because those are *necessary*.
__label__1	What a bernie bro
__label__-1	I too was surprised they don't have sick leave, but some companies must offer it as part of a package?
__label__-1	Lol no
__label__1	It says study in the title it must be true
__label__-1	Can I copypasta this to my facebook?
__label__1	Yeah, even if you ignore that op posted fom a main stream news source, you would be really hard pressed to find anything negative about the Clintons.
__label__1	I'm just waiting for the inevitable 'fake' leak that will prove once and for all that since one leak was fake then we can't trust any of them.
__label__-1	Notice, also, she is the only Democrat in the top 5 recipients of donations.
__label__-1	They can take whatever side they please when they start paying taxes.
__label__-1	At least until they're unfortunately jailed or sued.
__label__1	How can something that is undefined possibly be impossible?
__label__1	Those are obviously faked, everyone knows Obama is from Kenyan Muslim land.
__label__-1	So she learned in a face to face meeting with the NSA that her BlackBerry was not secure.
__label__-1	Now that he's figured out he can control the narrative by killing people, expect more of this.
__label__-1	[crying intensifies]
__label__1	That doesn't mean much, I have evidence that you are secretly a monkey with a computer.
__label__1	You dropped this:
__label__-1	It's easier for Jesus to walk on water when it's really thick.
__label__1	See, that's why women shouldn't be in politics
__label__1	How can a member of the left afford to pay for the sign when everyone against trump are jobless snowflakes who are on welfare.
__label__-1	Hey buddy, our good ol governor Perry needs that money for new boots and a revolver so he can keep playing cowboy.
__label__1	I hope the Russians and Chinese he's sharing the station with didn't influence his vote.
__label__1	Party of fiscal responsibility.
__label__1	Electing a shitty human being to be president, this is going to end well
__label__-1	"They should just rename it: ""The Koch Brothers House of Representatives""."
__label__1	Well if the kids had given him more lobby dollars he might have done something for them but those cheapskates ignored him.
__label__1	He's a great businessman.
__label__-1	Donnie, you really need to stop posting on reddit and get around to the business of governing.
__label__1	I have complete trust in 16 minute accounts.
__label__-1	They'll vote Republican again and again anyway
__label__-1	Is Moore one of them?
__label__-1	Anything to get him out of working on something important, says Bannon.
__label__-1	They used neither of their names in the title.
__label__-1	Say goodbye to the Democratic party.
__label__-1	I think the strategy is to throw so much shit around that the public and media aren't able to give enough attention to any of it.
__label__-1	True, but that's a personal choice to make, since it's an anticipated burden, and if a parent feels that they are not willing to deal with such a hardship and are within the first trimester (or the legal period for abortions) of their pregnancy, let them make that choice.
__label__-1	will any of the state pot laws matter when Attorney General Christie decides to actively enforce the federal drug laws that Obama has been looking the other way on?
__label__1	Why can't we just nuke them?
__label__-1	Bernie Sanders didn't make that claim, WaPo and other liars have.
__label__1	I am shocked shocked I tell you!
__label__-1	Sure, Minority President Donald, poke the bear why don't you.
__label__1	Ah, so THIS will be the thing that stops him.
__label__1	Yep, reddit is one person with one opinion
__label__-1	Nah, just a conservative boondoggle, another solution for a non existent problem to line their pals pockets.
__label__1	Totally DID NOT see this coming.
__label__-1	Sure, when republicans stop chopping the legs out from under them and do their jobs for a change.
__label__-1	Fake news
__label__-1	We should only drug test people who actually have a history related to drug use.
__label__1	Good thing he runs such a tight ship.
__label__1	Hispanics are getting duped by the dishonest media, but uneducated whites are seeing through the lies.
__label__-1	Alex Jones is the quintessential internet tough guy
__label__1	I thought it was a rainbow bumper sticker.
__label__-1	The laziest of replies.
__label__-1	because most americans don't want to spend there day off voting
__label__-1	Small fucking wonder when the american military defends most of Europe, South Korea and Japan.
__label__1	Clinton pushed him in assuming.
__label__1	This is why we need to re-commit to coal.
__label__-1	How did /politics ever get removed with top articles like this that ooze substance and inspire discussion?
__label__1	"These 40%ers need to don their ""Love Trumps Hate"" T-shirts and go out and beat up a few more Trump supporters."
__label__-1	I guess that makes Ted Cruz an utterly amoral pathological liar.
__label__1	They are voting to destroy Christianity!
__label__1	"Yeah but ""sticking it to the Washington elite"" was worth it!"
__label__1	For a million you get to pick one foreign policy move!
__label__1	Trump is winning!
__label__-1	The Hague.
__label__-1	I'm really happy he didn't win in 2008.
__label__1	Seriously, let's all treat Rush Limbaugh's xanga page as a legitimate news source.
__label__-1	Yuge.
__label__-1	From what I hear, you've been using your bill papers for ROLLING DOOBIES.
__label__-1	Probably easier to keep track of if we just report the list of news sources he doesn't consider fake.
__label__1	but obama played golf
__label__-1	I think I'm going to vote for the person who wants to be friends with the other people with lots of nukes.
__label__-1	Jingoist.
__label__1	Yeah I feel really sorry for him.
__label__-1	I hope his golf game is better than his intelligence
__label__-1	He can take that Thailand sex tourism route he always dreamed of
__label__-1	Blows my mind that this person is even in contention to be President
__label__1	I'm glad they're showing so much concern for the Socialists, Communists, Roma, and homosexuals who were also killed.
__label__1	But hey Breitbart is the best news source around, I mean just check out their conspiracy articles
__label__-1	Onion, just admit it, you're a bunch of amateurs compared to these guys.
__label__1	"""Who could've thought the climate is so complicated""...."
__label__-1	He's just trying to expand his electorate.
__label__-1	what a goddamn douchebag.... Anyone who voted for this POS deserves what they get.
__label__1	Sell more state land.
__label__1	I'm glad Cornel West can speak for all of us......
__label__1	Yeah because we should stop caring about politics after the presidential election.
__label__-1	Or you know... HIS IMPEACHMENT.
__label__-1	Yeah cause that'll fix their grades..being hungry.
__label__1	It only takes so long defending Donald Trump before you want to move on to bigger challenges and what's left apart from trying to redeem Hitler?
__label__1	Now why would that be?
__label__1	"Yeah, but the bible is fact and science is just a bunch of guesses aka ""theories""."
__label__1	PROVE THE RUSSIANS DIDNT WRITE THE EMAILS
__label__-1	Angry White Person Angry about White People
__label__-1	Are people still buying this stuff?
__label__-1	What is the most cost effective way to reduce recidivism rates should be adopted.
__label__1	As history has shown, prohibition always works.
__label__-1	They still can't overturn roe vs Wade until something like that comes up
__label__-1	/thread
__label__1	"Presidentissimo mr donald ""the perfect"" trump said that any negative poll is fake news so by that logic this is fake news, open your eyes sheeple"
__label__-1	Over budget and and ahead of impeachment schedule.
__label__-1	Meanwhile not a single person outside of upper management at the place I work has seen a raise in 7 years.
__label__-1	Didn't the Arab league offer to pay for it?
__label__1	But guys if they get tax cuts then it will help the middle class because trickle down
__label__1	If he runs and loses, will people finally stop saying he can win?
__label__-1	Barack Obama, makes himself king of the ocean.
__label__-1	Dude *says* a lot, doesn't seem to *accomplish* a lot.
__label__1	So I guess we can expect actions against corporations hiring illegals next, right?
__label__-1	Those glasses are boss
__label__1	Rasmussen says he's got a 78% approval rating though!
__label__-1	Two thirds of americans disagree with drumpf
__label__-1	Too bad yall took away the right to filibuster thinking you could never lose another election.
__label__1	Yes, a 54% approval rating of Obama will be what prevents Trump from being elected.
__label__1	Yeah that should have gone with something more reputable like the weekly standard or the washington times
__label__-1	Wow, that is really, really fucked up.
__label__1	Son obviously has superior genetics.
__label__-1	Reed lost me when he killed patent reform.
__label__-1	Ooooooooo he's a tryin.
__label__-1	That's democracy for you.
__label__-1	Just a friendly reminder that this is the AG that Trump bribed to drop an investigation against him.
__label__1	Well, she is kinda sorta brown so she must be a dirty Muslim sleeper cell!
__label__-1	"Anyone else remember the ""This is what a feminist looks like"" shirts being made by similar sweatshop women?"
__label__-1	Jesus... American politics is just downright embarrassing.
__label__-1	Hate crimes indeed, like that man in Chicago being pulled from his car by hooligans and viciously beaten on camera.
__label__-1	In other news water is still wet.
__label__1	Freedom of religion just means that you can belong to any denomination of Christianity you want.
__label__1	The documents are under routine audit by the IRS, he'll release them as soon as it's finished.
__label__1	they caught the hacker though so everything is good!
__label__-1	Yo I heard Trump was born in Kenya.
__label__1	"Obviously because the youngins are ""super predators"" !"
__label__1	Great, great man
__label__1	Gee, I was sure he'd endorse Trump
__label__1	BENGHAZI
__label__1	This just shows Trump is smart.
__label__-1	This is one of those rhetorical questions.
__label__-1	Having a job is optional is well, and I wouldn't have mine if I had no Internet.
__label__-1	Its almost like they should have punished the people at the bank instead of the bank itself.
__label__1	He's still black!
__label__1	Yes, he failed them, he has to go.
__label__-1	American citizens are real Americans, regardless of ethnicity.
__label__1	Dear white people: you're all evil.
__label__1	See it turns out things can be privately funded and the government doesn't have to have its' fingers in everything!
__label__1	So excited for her to change her mind once she doesn't have to pander!
__label__-1	Calling something bad for the military and linking a page of even handed commentary from a military paper.
__label__1	Pure coincidence I'm sure.
__label__-1	If they mention the CMP videos as part of any of this then they're idiots.
__label__-1	This is why we need to elect a president who stands for change... Someone who will restore the American dream and give us hope.
__label__1	That is because Cruz's wife took the hit for him, er, by him.
__label__-1	The clinton rape accusers made some sense but what does Trump hope to accomplish with this?
__label__-1	Why not terrorism?
__label__1	Yeah... all the other well-known polls are showing Trump has a 2-9% lead, but we better listen to this one poll that nobody's ever heard of before.
__label__1	Nothing suspicious about that.
__label__1	So glad to see them spending so much time on the important issues our country faces!
__label__-1	So CNN just gave 50 minutes of uninterrupted air time to Donald Trump because of Romney's speech.
__label__1	What is morality?
__label__1	Or perhaps they should pay people who eating healthy food.
__label__1	Oh man, can't wait for all those Vice Lords, GD's and various drug crews on the South Side to turn in their guns!
__label__-1	I feel like America is slathered in baby oil rocketing down a double black diamond
__label__-1	Adlai Stevenson?

__label__1	You put the punchline in the title!
__label__-1	"Department of ""Justice"""
__label__-1	It's looking like he needs to get it up in less than 4 years and also deport all the other Latinos so they can't vote against him in 2020.
__label__-1	Trying to be as far a humanly possible from Trump while remaining in the country.
__label__-1	They'll never blame republicans, but it's a form of scadenfreude
__label__1	Better get rid of Planned Parenthood.
__label__-1	Given the manner in which Trump announced his presidential bid, Latinos would have to be insane not to vote against him in massive numbers.
__label__-1	"I'm no fan of Ted Cruz, but whether someone is a ""natural-born citizen"" or not is totally meaningless and has nothing to do with someone's qualifications for high office"
__label__1	"I hope ""the criminals"" don't realize that upgrading to iOS8 means ""the law"" can't touch them."
__label__-1	How about his raging hypocrisy?
__label__1	"Surely, it's just a coincidence that Wikileaks chose today to publish a dump that will give the Trump campaign the ""It's all a CIA false flag defense."""
__label__1	Newfangled pope from the new world, I guess I can wait until another old world pope comes along to correct.
__label__1	Nah, according to republicans, midterms went perfectly fine and gave them a mandate to impeach obama.
__label__1	but he sacrificed so much by hiring people for jobs.
__label__-1	Rubio rekt trump
__label__1	Ya know, cause spending money is free speech and my free speech definitely allows me to limit someone's healthcare coverage.
__label__1	fucking socialism, they need to be gathered up and shipped out of the country.
__label__-1	Treason.
__label__-1	Please list benefits/consequences of Britain leaving EU, and the impact it will have on US politics and economy.
__label__-1	If that's true, you can kiss that market rally goodbye.
__label__1	Who is this guy?
__label__-1	What about Miss Fiorina?
__label__1	A single payer healthcare provider should not decide in death panels who gets treatment - when a quick look at your bank account gives the answer how much better you managed your own life so far to pay all hospital bills easily by yourself
__label__1	She committed blasphemy
__label__1	gee, didn't see that coming at all.
__label__1	Clearly Goldman Sachs is part of the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy to make Obama look good.
__label__-1	Did she pay taxes?
__label__1	Can you imagine if that Muslim, Barack Hussein Obama had denounced Jesus on December 26th, 2009?
__label__-1	Congrats, everyone, we've become Australia!
__label__1	Sounds fair and well reasoned.
__label__-1	This should be fun.
__label__1	Apparently there's plenty of alternate evidence
__label__1	Think of all the jobs hes creating in law enforcement!
__label__1	Why should he even bother the situation in Furguson has nothing to do with his job.
__label__-1	and if he didnt do something all of you would be bitching no matter what he does you all will bitch
__label__1	Well, there should be a special place in hell for these women.
__label__1	FREEDOM!
__label__1	I'm waiting for the invisible hand of the free market to clean up this mess.
__label__-1	95k already, this should be at 100k in a few hours.
__label__-1	"""Debacle"" makes it sound like it wasn't intentional."
__label__-1	"The truth is....""our truth"""
__label__1	We've all been there
__label__1	I can't imagine who would do such a thing!
__label__1	Yeah, but who cares a few people are getting rich on it, right?
__label__-1	They have to be housed separately and the appeals process is costly and can drag on for decades.
__label__1	Shh, let the smart people interpret the numbers for you.
__label__1	Wow, thanks Russia!
__label__-1	Was this a secret?
__label__-1	Let's just declare war on **everyone**!
__label__1	That's the Sessions I know!
__label__1	Good thing superdelegates are the ones really in charge then!
__label__1	Human rights list is just another arm of the crooked evil MSMBCNNine11...
__label__-1	Just because they steal doesn't mean we all do.
__label__1	Yeah, cause that's WAAAY more important than arming Mexican Drug cartels to kill innocent men, women, children, and US Law Enforcement agents.
__label__1	IF only people could see on their TVs that Obama is black they wouldn't have to play the race card.
__label__-1	Pure fucking darkness.
__label__1	They should be working to eliminate studies on gravity.... then we could all fly!
__label__1	Hillary Clinton is basically Dick Cheney in a pantsuit.
__label__-1	This is worse than endorsing Hillary.. ugh
__label__1	Man, it really seemed like they were going Trump Train.
__label__1	But then the Upper management can not afford to go on that 10th trip to Tahiti, fuck you socialism for ruining everything for the very few.
__label__1	Trump supporters totally aren't racist so it just doesn't matter how racist we look in front of 7 billion people because we aren't.
__label__1	Obama vaguely spoke ill of the chosen one...he must be a Republican...BURN HIM!
__label__-1	I'd like to believe this guy 100%, but something tells me we are missing a few relevant facts.
__label__1	Yeah, but he screwed a Latina and had an anchor baby with her so he's biased too.
__label__1	There's much more important things to talk about, like How Donald tweeted that some actor is a big meanie.
__label__1	In fairness, I'm sure that the application for firearm purchase and background check will also ask if people want to register to vote
__label__1	Guess I'll get my governor back!
__label__-1	Care to expand your highly educated and profound thought?
__label__-1	Just curious - what's the difference between corporate totalitarianism and fascism?
__label__1	Keep it up, lib, you're going to make 2020 easy for us.
__label__1	I'm sure he didn't take a litmus test for Trump.
__label__1	"Gee... Now THERE""S a surprise!"
__label__-1	Colin don't care Colin don't give a fuck
__label__1	"""i've never shot a gun before, but let me tell you why they're shit!"""
__label__-1	"This just proves that the ""freedom"" America is long dead."
__label__1	Now if only we could make LGBT status a protected class... But that's special rights, I guess.
__label__-1	Why do we care about what Chelsea Clinton thinks?
__label__-1	And Clinton takes millions from Saudis that throw gay people of roofs :^)
__label__-1	Sorry Bernie, that's a stupid proposal.
__label__-1	What a shocker, you reap what you sow LE.
__label__1	He's not even a real democrat!
__label__-1	Meh, I thought it was an article about him cracking down on my slavery to the government.
__label__-1	I don't want a man in the bathroom with me so I'm torn on this issue.
__label__1	Hope there where waambulances at the event.
__label__1	This is why we need a businessman in the White House!
__label__-1	I have a feeling that if all of the so called GOP leaders were recorded speaking their true feelings that the country would be completely shocked.
__label__-1	Republican Government Shutdown Would Cut Off Food Stamps To Tens Of Millions, USDA Says
__label__-1	the state has no business stifling social protest in any way.
__label__1	Oh well I'll definitely be swayed by Bill because who can you trust more for the truth than the spouse of the person running?
__label__-1	Hillary's husband stuck a cigar inside an interns vagina in the white house.
__label__1	Who ever heard of a volcano causing problems for people?
__label__1	Yes, let's take ourselves out of the Security Council.. Real fucking smart move!
__label__1	I'm sure her cigarette smoking, dinner wine drinking daddy will be horrified.
__label__-1	state sponsored media is fake news

__label__-1	Cops also seized her vibrator too
__label__1	Dear God, don't force me drink real Havana Club, that would be terrible.
__label__-1	"The Republican Party is two parties that hate each other, almost as much as they hate Democrats, banding together to secure the ""majority"" and keep the actual majority from running the country."
__label__-1	"It's always ""may have"" dems pushing this too hard and it's gonna end up being absolutely nothing."
__label__1	Both of them are called 'literally' Hitler, both of them are being called racists, both of them are being called sexists!
__label__1	You sexist!
__label__1	Obviously filthy liberal lies and propaganda against the greatest health care system the world has ever seen!
__label__-1	Trump running for president: 'Horrible' but these things happen
__label__-1	You sir or madam are a bafoon.
__label__1	But there is that People's Republic of China... Out with the old, and in with the new!

__label__1	Oh no, what a loss.
__label__-1	Trump-Russia claims: Circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception- Schiff
__label__-1	so many things this year that shouldnt even require politifact to chime in -.-
__label__1	Yeah, but did you see how small Trump's hands are?
__label__-1	People of Wis need to wake up pronto!
__label__-1	If in 4 years the Left doesn't have anyone better than this moron, we're well and truly fucked.
__label__1	But Obama was an illegal kenyan so he doesn't know how a *real* presidency works
__label__1	I would hate to see a repeat of Bill's peace and prosperity.
__label__1	does everyone's vote have the same weight in this poll or are 4 NY votes equal to one from Wyoming?
__label__1	"""Party of personal responsibility"""
__label__-1	Good
__label__-1	The main problem is, Trump only represents a minority of the country and that minority doesn't include Indian-Americans.
__label__1	Gaga for Senate!
__label__1	"""Planned parenthood repealed"" - Trump"
__label__-1	Ah yes, the Putin package, you probably can't afford it.
__label__-1	So you're voting for a religious extremist?
__label__-1	Amen to that.
__label__-1	I wonder if they realize that Trump is leading in trustworthiness, while media are even behind Hillary.
__label__-1	Wrong
__label__-1	Someone who loves their neighbor as their own, unless their neighbor is anything other than a carbon copy of themselves.
__label__1	Because that kind of operation against the cartels would totally be profitable and not a net loss of money at all.
__label__-1	We need to recognize, after all of this executive order insanity that Trump is not only capable, but likely to push the button on North Korea.
__label__-1	Clickbait headline = downvote.
__label__-1	Of course he does
__label__1	I'm shocked.
__label__-1	This is so stupid, it's hard to even get upset at it.
__label__-1	So wait they would get actual trials under Trump?
__label__-1	"Yeah he said ""leave Iraq"", not ""leave Iraq and pour more weapons into KSA while ignoring their nuclear ambitions with Pakistan, and then shit all over Syria and Libya while winking to Iran"""
__label__1	Shit, let's wait to see how the next article says he really wanted to use an ar15.
__label__1	We'll if they'd used our copy of Constitution these rogue judges would never have ruled against us.
__label__1	Rubio seems focused on issues that matter.
__label__-1	My respect for McCain just increased greatly.

__label__1	Literally destroying democracy
__label__-1	Sanders
__label__-1	You just can't have people using science and learning things.
__label__1	Yea but those poor corporations *really* want to develop that land, why won't anything think about them?
__label__1	That's one way to win over the millennial vote.
__label__1	Just another one of those young, white Bernie Bros who just got into the election to burn everything down.
__label__1	Fox is definitely my go to source for credible analysis of democrat agendas
__label__1	Shocker
__label__-1	Yes, war is hell.
__label__1	Are these kind of posts allowed in this sub?
__label__-1	I clicked on the article expecting to read some neat-o scientific quirky method that allowed people to cheaply cool their houses in super-hot areas.
__label__1	Maybe they need more tax cuts
__label__-1	It's like watching a really shitty movie somehow got a reboot, but with a director even shitter than the first one.
__label__-1	Give us new idiots with new bad ideas and new false beliefs.
__label__1	In my expierence the media just completely gives up when there's fresh meat for the taking.
__label__1	can't wait to scalia to come up with some reason to justify it and thomas to follow lockstep in his place
__label__-1	An old obese man sitting up at 3am watching porn, and tweeting about, is not the image I want in a President.
__label__1	Yeah, and obviously Hillary left a note at the scene
__label__-1	Grass green, water blue.
__label__1	but emails
__label__1	PROcreation not RECreation!
__label__1	Not Honest Hill
__label__-1	I wonder how many of the anti-minimum wage posters on reddit could care less about unemployment and just don't want to pay a few cents more at McDonalds and Walmart?
__label__-1	Glad to see the White House is wise enough to not blame millions of people, including Americans, for the actions of one man who most likely suffered from mental illness.
__label__-1	Your average high school year book team would have more clarity of purpose and organized delivery than this WH.
__label__-1	Must of been a hell of a hacker.
__label__1	What a mature and well-constructed rant..
__label__1	Good luck.
__label__-1	Americans only care about embryos.
__label__1	So they used Wikileaks?
__label__1	If only more people had more guns, this wouldn't happen
__label__-1	Has been.
__label__1	And definitely just a coincidence.
__label__1	They should hire mercenaries instead, privatizing our military would make it more efficient and cost effective.
__label__-1	I get all of that under Obamacare.
__label__-1	Shame on you GOP.
__label__-1	Gomer knows hacks, he looked in the mirror.
__label__1	Hey, come on...109 vs 90,000...they're just alternative facts!
__label__-1	He'll be in court anyway, testifying in his child rape case, so this is more of a time-saver.
__label__-1	I was hoping Trump would not be president, but I've never seen Vox be right about anything, so I guess he is in.
__label__1	And definitely, *definitely*, not the US.
__label__-1	Right about now is a great time to invest in companies who manufacture ammo clips with *one round less* than the legal limit!
__label__-1	Give this guy his participation trophy, after 8+million spent, he's earned it!
__label__-1	Scott Walker has officially passed Paul Ryan as the most punchable douchebag in existence.
__label__1	Well, DJT is president so he must be doing something better than you.
__label__1	I hate Mexicans ever since the Alamo.
__label__-1	If this guy isn't guilty of something, he sure acts like someone who is
__label__1	Yay more anti union legislation!
__label__-1	it's hard to give a shit about numbers like these when 40+ percent of the country didn't vote.
__label__1	Spitefully holding onto ridiculous grudges is the kind of quality America looks for in a President.
__label__-1	what is a fax machine?
__label__-1	I fucking said it when Bernie said he'd show up that she'd attend too.
__label__1	Well, California does have the economic output of a major country so that is possible...except for all the socialist in California.
__label__1	Yeah, she totally isn't a Republican though.
__label__1	But think of all the bankruptcy attorneys it would put out of business!
__label__-1	That just might inspire even more votes for HRC!
__label__1	Wonder why Drudge Report or Breitbart haven't reported on this at all today?
__label__1	"That article did not mention ""Groping"", ""Pussy"" or ""assault""... It was pretty boring..."
__label__-1	Hey, some I assume are good people.
__label__1	Because we all remember how Obama took away our guns!
__label__-1	There is nothing civil about that crap.
__label__1	Damn it Obama
__label__1	An agoraphobic whose never even driven a car.
__label__-1	Yeah but then they already voted for it, so fuck them and theirv discomfort.
__label__1	Next thing you know dogs will be marrying cats!
__label__1	Cuz that will calm things down.
__label__1	there are republican Jews?
__label__1	That doesn't sound at all like Donald Trump.
__label__-1	"Maybe Trump can point to this and say ""see Russia say it didn't happen, ignore our intelligence agencies, only Russia would be honest."""
__label__1	yah, at that point they don't even count as people anymore!
__label__-1	I'm surprised they caught it at all.
__label__1	Historically speaking limiting the poors access to wealth has always helped raise them out of poverty.
__label__1	Well, that settles it then...
__label__1	I am sure all the Berniebros know more about the situation on the border than these guys though.
__label__1	Well they are the job creators
__label__-1	Don't forget switching back to the gold standard as well.
__label__-1	"And then they came for the porn, and that's how the Republicans lost all their ""white working class"" supporters."
__label__-1	But not in America.
__label__-1	Lindsay Graham says he was hacked.
__label__1	Wow that really hurt my feelings
__label__-1	I always tell liberals the best thing about having a republican in charge is the press cares about things like this.
__label__1	Yeah but did he hide some emails?
__label__-1	How long before breitbart runs a semi-racist article about Michelle burning tax payer monies?
__label__-1	Open and shut case, Johnson.
__label__1	Thanks goodness Obama only wants to increase Military Spending by $2.05 Trillion.
__label__1	But thank GOD they aren't increasing taxes on the rich
__label__1	Because it isn't a disease?
__label__1	"Sir, I believe you mean ""GOP reaches compromise with Democratic Senator"""

__label__1	Or as she calls it, freeing those kids from repressive regulations so they can reach their full potential without shackles.
__label__-1	Really scraping the bottom of the weapons barrel.
__label__1	I trust Obama to keep his word.
__label__1	I'm still not sure what his endgame is though
__label__-1	Whoops.
__label__1	Corporations deserve the right to vote and hold office.
__label__-1	In 2 years, people are going to be so fed up with Trump's mismanagement that the house will swing back democratic.
__label__-1	He equates chickens with food which vegetarians do not.
__label__1	Thank goodness our good information providers present this topic somewhere every day because it is essential to our economic and political well being.

__label__-1	I can't be the only one who isn't surprised by this shit anymore
__label__-1	The MPAA needs to be forced to disband.
__label__1	Hillary does not lie with every breath - she also coughs at times!
__label__-1	Yes.
__label__-1	Easy fix: lower the corporate tax rate.
__label__-1	It's getting pathetic at this point!
__label__-1	She needs a prescription so she doesn't look so anxious and nervous in her interviews.
__label__-1	Good luck with that.
__label__1	I wonder why nobody is doing any polls of Trump vs Bill Clinton?
__label__-1	Maybe I'm confused but didn't they already do that?
__label__-1	They're not fake truths, theyre alternative facts.
__label__-1	Good.
__label__1	But he's more electable!
__label__-1	maybe you can't stump the trump but you can AHEH AEGH GET TO THE CHOPPAH trump
__label__1	It's always the more mature and respectable practice to punish the unsuspecting children.
__label__-1	Trump to be paid $3million/year for renting space in Trump Tower to the Secret Service.
__label__-1	If they put out Cruz can we put out Sanders please?
__label__-1	If it's from ThinkProgress, it will never happen.
__label__1	Yeah FDR was a punk bitch too!
__label__-1	No one is saying that the government should punch Nazis.
__label__-1	Clinton doesn't like American citizens too much, she'd rather replace us with other, more compliant peoples.
__label__-1	I love this women
__label__1	so then they vote again right?
__label__1	Obama spending more time on vacation.
__label__-1	Kim Jong Un declares himself emperor of the world: MORE useless actions AT 10!
__label__1	Well that will help save some money to pay for his tax plan
__label__-1	Can't help it laugh at the idiot.
__label__1	the poll has to be skewed, or something
__label__-1	It doesn't follow that you can't lead a nation by virtue of being a theist.
__label__-1	Well, the CIA seem concerned that he may be an agent of Putin's Russia, and they are not averse to assassinating people.
__label__-1	We're also due for another recession in about two years which could have the potential to wipe out most if not all of those gains with all of the deregulation that's being imposed.
__label__1	Trump tied to people who are rasist waat no way
__label__-1	This is the appropriate era of McCarthyism.
__label__1	Must be all the NRA members and Republicans in Chicago.
__label__-1	I'm sure they were all hoping, perhaps rooting for casualties today
__label__1	I'm sure that guy's dad has no business relationships with Trump Inc whatsoever :D
__label__1	Sauce?
__label__-1	The Democratic Establishment is connected to the 249 Democratic members of congress too.
__label__1	Wow, that's amazing that he also thinks he's the one who decides what's good and evil, because I was totally sure I was the one.
__label__-1	My way or the highway, waaa waaaaaaa
__label__1	Yeah, because I believe anything the media says.
__label__1	Just a few bad apples.
__label__1	Hes a young go getter with fresh ideas!
__label__1	This will really assist in the Democrats winning back the rust belt in 2020.
__label__-1	Bullshit article written in the same condescending voice that lost the Democrats the election.
__label__-1	Republicans: America's well-organized sociopaths
__label__1	and you think they might know a bit about security
__label__-1	Buyer's Remorse?
__label__1	And the whole obsession with the Syrian children dying to chemical weapons.
__label__-1	Well, they just weren't shot leaving a store, they were shot while leaving a store after armed robbing it.
__label__1	But...cheetochimp made money off the deal...what a smart business man!
__label__1	If corporations are 'citizens' and are eligible for certain rights, then why shouldn't a foreign country be recognized as a 'person' and be allowed similar rights?
__label__1	Because of course illegal aliens are in state residents and deserve it.
__label__1	This just shows what great Americans they are, to put forth this expenditure to fight the over taxation of the people.
__label__-1	Don't break up the banks, I am a bank after all.
__label__1	But anyone who supports any universal health care system besides single-payer is a Republican, didn't you hear?
__label__1	Cuz fuck the poor, amiright?
__label__-1	But... the founding fathers were Deists... ._.
__label__1	Oh, you go girl.

__label__1	because all the black people DUH!
__label__-1	How much do you wanna bet that the only place we see a concession from him is on social media if he loses?
__label__1	She's probably a big sharks fan too
__label__1	OMG I wonder who he would've endorsed!
__label__-1	"Dear Leader needs a ""Love Me"" rally to pick up his spirits."

__label__-1	Reddit rejoices!
__label__-1	You misspelled rapeslaveryatgunpoint bro.
__label__-1	So?
__label__1	Bernie could have won the endorsement of the Gay Steel Maker Union, but they're too establishment for him.
__label__1	Pink News is so reliable.
__label__-1	This is related to Oregon how?
__label__1	I don't see what's so hard to understand...only the states Trump is losing in are rigging the election!
__label__-1	Unsurprisingly, the Congressmen responsible are a rogues' gallery of puppets for the Koch criminals.
__label__1	What a shock!
__label__1	I'm sure all those 60 something conservatives think this will be just great.
__label__-1	But...but...Trump said....!
__label__1	"Clearly you realize this is the first step in the march towards the inevitable government mandated chemical castration of ""undesirables"" Wake up sheeple."
__label__-1	from the nationalized fed
__label__1	Oh my, she's filling Hillary's shoes.
__label__-1	Throwing a few dollars business Podesta's way does not make up for the billions worth of value of owning a US President.
__label__1	"""Proof Donald is winning"" Polls Schmolls....Rallies are where its at."
__label__-1	You would only consider his record outstanding if you were a raci.... oh Spicers statement makes sense now.
__label__1	Ann Couter is in tears.
__label__1	Screw that peaceful protest nonsense.
__label__-1	Well if that's not enough reason to vote for Hillary right there.... Though, surprise, people whose only success was reality TV are sticking together.

__label__-1	Putin is laughing his ass off with all the protest going on.
__label__1	First broken election promise?
__label__1	Of course a fucking frog would say something of this nature, just look at how great their socialist economy is doing!
__label__1	That lack of a Trump endorsement is costing him dearly.
__label__1	That's great, what's his tax policy?
__label__-1	He isn't taking a the salary given to the president either.

__label__1	don't worry, they'll still be protected under existing laws
__label__-1	Is it really all that surprising given how many people disapproved of him before he became president?

__label__-1	Most of the world made less in a year than Hillary made in a single speech.
__label__-1	Team Jefferson!
__label__1	Thank you unions.
__label__-1	A link to a question on a Twitter page gets you 3,547 upvotes?
__label__1	Why would a nuclear Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt be a threat to Israeli security?
__label__1	Yeah, because no black people voted for trump
__label__-1	Trump will then charged, convicted and executed for genocide, hopefully Bush will be the last President who got away with war crimes.
__label__1	Can't stump the Trump!
__label__1	I'm sure criminals will quickly take advantage of this law and start carrying their guns openly.

__label__-1	So, fewer than half.
__label__-1	If he was so popular, then do explain, why he failed to win his primary?
__label__1	But regulation is the source of all evil in the economy and should be completely done away with!
__label__1	Ah, yes, the GOP is the evil empire.
__label__1	But, it's those Muslims we need to worry about.
__label__1	But he's white and Republican so he's not the problem.
__label__-1	Yeah but it rains a bunch so don't come here it's not as good as people keeping telling you, I'm sure these savings will pass too you can visit but you totally don't want to live in this paradise nope nope nope.
__label__1	Good thing Harry Reid made it impossible to filibuster federal judges and Obama left with over 100 vacancies.
__label__-1	The other 38% must be the independents who *want* the Dems to keep losing everything.
__label__1	Yeah, but think of all the tanks that would otherwise go unused, and the brave men and women that build them.
__label__-1	4 more years, enjoy
__label__-1	So what you are saying is that you are willing to destroy the world economy JUST to get the nigger out of office?

__label__-1	Nice try, terrorists...
__label__-1	God help us all.
__label__1	I'm sure they'll welcome him with open arms after 6 months of him trash talking them.
__label__1	Texans go to school?
__label__-1	I like how the free market is triggering conservatives now.
__label__-1	I'm sure he had an excellent time taking Trump's sand wedge in up to his duodenum.
__label__1	And as we can see, this worked well.
__label__-1	Me: Why is Kaine still a thing?
__label__1	But but but, both parties the saaaame!

__label__1	I'm sure without those rules they would never betray their customers
__label__-1	I know right, America will vote that black guy into office for 8 years but become racist as fuck when a crazy white bitch runs for office
__label__-1	His own lawyer lies under oath, so he's just going to be lying the entire time.

__label__1	Good thing both parties are the same
__label__-1	"HERE'S THE TRANSLATION: ""If you make lots of money, you will pay less taxes... If you make less money and barely get by, living paycheck to paycheck, you will pay more taxes. """

__label__-1	can he claim those on his taxes?
__label__1	I say go for it.

__label__-1	I guess we know which regulations are getting cut next.
__label__-1	Are any reputable outlets reporting this story?
__label__-1	As long as it was not a white supremacist terrorist attack he will comment.
__label__1	Is it wrong to lie?
__label__-1	I am appalled, these peasants are *revolting*.

__label__-1	Pics or it didnt happen
__label__1	FINALLY some dirt on this guy.
__label__-1	None of this is about issues any more.
__label__1	The circumstances surrounding this latest piece do not at all call into question its credibility.
__label__-1	Are these the same polls that said Hillary was a 93% chance to win?
__label__-1	...And the piss rains down!
__label__1	Man, if elections are so fraudulent, we should just stop having them.
__label__-1	And this is not racism how?
__label__1	That's certainly on the same level as winking to your supporters that they should shoot your opponent if she wins.
__label__1	Phew...and I thought there might have been constitutional infringements!
__label__1	Our lord emperor is scared of no man, just wait and see what he tweets next.

__label__1	"I'm sure after he ""answers"" all of these questions it will all be put the rest and we will never ever hear anything about it ever again."

__label__1	Great.
__label__-1	And if anything goes wrong under Trump it'll be Obama's fault.
__label__-1	Yeeeaaaaaaahhhhh, but this sample size is crazy small to draw this sort of conclusion, especially considering a number of states without background checks had no shootings (such as NH, ME, and VT; a full half of New England)
__label__1	That's a good way to help them get jobs so they can pay their loans back.
__label__-1	Jesus Mepper all you do is bitch about the rich
__label__1	Homophobia raises it's evil head.
__label__-1	I saw David Farenthold on multiple MSNBC shows, so they've spent about equal time on this story and the skittles thing.
__label__-1	Just a question... if you feel being LGBTQ is a choice and you don't support gay marriage your are an anti-LGBTQ Extremist?
__label__-1	Thanks Obama.
__label__-1	She did well.
__label__-1	Why should policy be based on helping any group over another?
__label__-1	I bet it will start looking like the Berlin wall pretty quickly.
__label__1	Well, at least he's consistent about something.
__label__1	We are all happy they have nothing more important to do.

__label__-1	If you like your plan, you're going to have to change it every year.
__label__1	"""It's only welfare leeches and refugees."""
__label__1	Well, wrap it up folks, no Donald Trump campaign anymore, that's it, show's over, let's take a look at the other candidates.
__label__1	Who would have guessed !
__label__1	Gee it'd be a shame we don't get to see who he'd invite to sit next to Melania at the State of the Union every year.
__label__1	Not if the Gay Fish People who did 9/11 have anything to say about it...!
__label__-1	Sickening, but are there any Republicans other than John McCain who have spoken out against torture?
__label__1	because no one ever threatens Trump
__label__1	Oh look at that, I guess it's time for the police to arrest more people for jay walking, loitering, drinking beer in public, and menacing.
__label__-1	I'm waiting for Trump to make a misstep so bigly that Russia just says fuck it and releases the video.
__label__1	I'm glad someone is working hard to unskew the polls
__label__-1	I'm not sure why this matters.
__label__-1	"How the fuck is this not ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" Please explain to me what mental gymnastics explain this blatant misunderstanding of the constitution."
__label__-1	and the rent is too damn high!
__label__-1	he'll look into it.
__label__-1	Angry fired staffer makes unsubstantiated claims, suit says
__label__-1	Can we get a list of people china has criticized?
__label__-1	lol.
__label__-1	Disgusting
__label__-1	Every single post on the front page is either pro-Bernie or anit-Hillary (minus the few neutral ones that slipped through), there really hasn't been any doubt for a while now.
__label__1	Come on god I keep praying to you to remove the Palin family from the evils of this earth and still you do nothing.
__label__1	Perfect logic here.
__label__-1	"Looks like we have a contender for, ""Lie of the year."""
__label__1	How dare you conservatives, Hillary is a fucking saint!
__label__1	BUT BOTH PARTIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME!
__label__1	Still better than Hillary
__label__-1	SD, is green in a sea of yellow.
__label__1	Such a Grand ol Party.
__label__-1	Shit like this is why we need to really update the constitution!
__label__-1	Also, it is surprising that 'freedom fighters' became terrorists only when America got hurt.
__label__1	What, the side that broke the record on using something wants to get rid of it now that it's not convenient, surely they see the hypocrisy.
__label__1	But this sub led me to believe only republicans rig elections
__label__1	I'm glad to see that the GOP is talking about the issues that really matter
__label__-1	Clinton has not earned any progressive fans in the last six months, quite the opposite, Sanders voters can't help but notice the contempt she has for them.
__label__1	But remember folks COHEN was never in Prague or Russia and has nothing to do with this.
__label__1	As long as they protect the ACA
__label__-1	In the strictest sense of the law actually he would not be eligible, although his mother meets most of the technical requirements for her child to be considered a US citizen despite being born in Canada, it could be challenged on the basis his mother never applied to the American embassy to get his Consulate Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) or FS-240 or DS-1350 which would document him as an American citizen.
__label__1	The communists have won!
__label__-1	Or, they flat out refused because they knew there was a shitton of shady and illegal stuff on the severs as it is... just saying.
__label__1	And Jill Stein lost for the exact same reason.
__label__1	It's Obama's fault!
__label__1	Define 'actual'
__label__1	Just remember, Republicans are the same as Democrats.
__label__-1	Interested to hear what Bernie supporters have to say about this information, as this directly contradicts what he and his team have been saying for months.
__label__1	Great, I know I go out of my way to frequent foodhandling services that don't offer proper health care to their employees.
__label__-1	If you take 200 grand from pharmaceutical companies then probably yes.
__label__-1	Trouble is if the establishment Republicans went public with the policies they are *really* pushing only rich people would vote for them.
__label__-1	Tornado warnings are librrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrulllllllllllllllllllll conspiracies!
__label__1	Well some jobs are better than keeping no jobs, right?
__label__1	Damn busybodies.
__label__1	not voting until I hear who the Old Farmer's Almanac endorses
__label__1	Oh right, that six-figure Clinton Foundation payment that totally exists and definitely was not an easily discredited scam.
__label__1	This is going to end well for him.
__label__1	Remember: Hillary's the corrupt one.
__label__-1	Kiss criminal justice reform goodbye and listen to the silence of the embarrassed Republicans that call themselves libertarians.
__label__1	"""Those damn Muslims coming over here forcing our kids to learn Arabic Numerals, we need to teach them Western Christian Numerals"""
__label__1	But Trump received a purple heart!
__label__-1	Conservative republicans are the cancer of society.
__label__-1	Sadly, the Rick Roll was not mentioned in the statement.
__label__-1	McCain for president!
__label__1	I dunno...if you ask my grandpa, Obama is the racist in chief and the real reason for the uptick in racial tensions
__label__1	It is so nice to see direct representation at work.
__label__1	No, it was only planned by Saudis and committed by mostly Saudis, all following an extremist version of Islam associated with the Saudi regime.
__label__1	Lock her up!
__label__1	All of them are old white guys, who'd have guessed that?
__label__-1	Kim Davis fans are going to be outraged.
__label__1	And it is all the fault of conservatives in general and Bush specifically.
__label__-1	"""The lahaaand of the freeheehee"" That's really freedom, not to be allowed to travel to certain countries."
__label__1	We'll be annexing Canadia soon.
__label__-1	Wait, you're surprised that reality may differ from what's been circulating the reddit bubble of misinformation?
__label__-1	*holds
__label__1	I'm sure this will end the minute he assumes the office of President of the United States.
__label__1	Wow, I had no idea Robert Gates was such an awful anti-semite.
__label__1	Sounds like a mandate to me.
__label__1	This is an excellent way to repair Trump's image among millennials.
__label__1	No one respects women more than he does.
__label__-1	Today is a sad day for Democracy.
__label__1	What could go wrong?
__label__-1	This was on the front page for most of the weekend.
__label__-1	This will not be a popular position to take
__label__-1	Damn faggots ruin everything
__label__1	"He clearly was a ""bad hombre,"" Tzar Trump would never lie to us."
__label__-1	Do we once again get treated to a Republican drama queen show stopping event?
__label__-1	this is only funny is she brought said note pinned to her shirt while presenting it to the press.
__label__1	**SOCIALIST**
__label__1	Even if they pass the grandparent rule?
__label__1	Wow, maybe Seattle voters will start electing Democrats so they can clean that police force up.
__label__1	Innovation!
__label__1	I think he means 'merica done got smart
__label__-1	Welp all your poor people in rural towns who voted for trump are about to lose your healthcare
__label__-1	Top kek.
__label__-1	It is worth noting that, even after this ruling, the Hobby Lobby health plan still covers 16 types of birth control.
__label__-1	To be fair, toddlers **have** killed more people in the US than refugees.
__label__1	"She didn't need the security because she knew she would be getting a ""security inquiry"""
__label__-1	Do we need more evidence of her wrong doing?
__label__1	NO its your fault for not taking bills throbbing member down your esophagus!
__label__-1	I always get those two confused.
__label__1	Later Trump said he was confusing it with the 12 Commandments.
__label__-1	None of this really matters, the dems will gain this cycle and when the small recession hits in 2-4 years the voters are going to toss them out of power in 2020 leading to a Wisconsin/Michigan style congressional gerrymandering of epic proportions ensuring GOP control of the house forever.
__label__1	associated press, another in a long line of republican smear merchants
__label__1	Sure, better than (God forbid) a black guy or woman.
__label__-1	But the secret service are obviously paid schills that are just doing Hillary's bidding right now, right guys?
__label__-1	"I feel like I could be a moderately successful alt-right blogger if I just wrote a bunch of gibberish with ""Deep State"" and ""Globalists"" sprinkled in."
__label__-1	Is any week?
__label__1	Trump only listens to heroes.
__label__1	Get your robes cleaned and pressed because Catholics are back on the menu boys.
__label__-1	Didn't this first time on record happen thousands of years ago in China?
__label__-1	ah, no
__label__-1	Turd Nugget
__label__-1	Man, Bob Newhart is scaring the shit out of me.
__label__1	Wow, such transparency in this administration.
__label__-1	If we are to have a serious discussion can we get a serious link?
__label__1	Who knew that making an industry legal would create more jobs.... .Hmmm sure surprised me
__label__1	It's all just sanders supporters who are angry their candidate lost.
__label__-1	How many wars have Hillary, Bill, or Obama served in?
__label__-1	Perhaps?
__label__1	But this has nothing to do with Muslims!
__label__1	But how can a socialist/marxist program lead to greater capitalism?
__label__1	Yea I'm sure this is really going to hit the female pro-life demographic where it hurts.
__label__-1	But I thought everyone on welfare was a lazy drug addict!
__label__-1	He's gonna end the meals on wheels fat cats!
__label__1	Probably Hitlery
__label__-1	Gary Johnson for president!
__label__-1	2% seems awfully high
__label__1	Nah guys, you don't understand, it's not a Nazi thing, it's just Pennsylvania Dutch.
__label__1	"""I believe children are our future...unless we stop them here and now!"""
__label__1	That's exactly what a country that invented a climate change hoax would say
__label__1	"I think the title is a bit misleading, should read: ""*Soros's paid protesters attack honorable man trying to serve his community*"""
__label__-1	Another incredible endorsement pickup by Clinton!
__label__-1	If Trump is guilty of treason, there is literally nothing Democrats should work with Trump on.
__label__1	Because hillary and the media says we do.
__label__-1	"Tune in tomorrow for another episode of ""Is the FBI good or is it bad depending on what we prefer on /redacted"""
__label__1	She's right, if truth kills then it's a good thing assassination attempt.
__label__1	Like we did with the Japanese, brilliant.
__label__-1	Alternative Patriotism
__label__-1	Trashy behavior is par for course for a liar and shill like Conway.
__label__1	Leave it to the Liberal Conspiracy Network to demonize a strong supporter of small independent business women.
__label__1	Always a good use of tax money
__label__-1	Luckily SHE has HealthCare.
__label__-1	Oh, Reddit cares about spike lee now?
__label__1	Move on, nothing to see here.
__label__-1	i want to watch him actually do it
__label__-1	Good Find, Have an Orangered or two
__label__1	Bernie Sanders has Gus Fring's support!
__label__1	Yeah that'll get passed by Congress for sure.
__label__-1	"This is like saying ""Hilary has dinner after lamenting world hunger""."
__label__1	Authentic Italian workers!
__label__1	They tried wearing those identification bracelets, but the Justice Department took them away.
__label__-1	Because the right's primary electorate was deranged and the field had waaaaayy too many candidates.
__label__-1	It was the interest on that 400mill
__label__-1	Is this seriously still a meme on this sub?
__label__-1	do you think we'd be all up in that mess if they didn't have oil?
__label__-1	I don't like that either.
__label__-1	With how demented some on the left have become when it comes to President Trump, better safe than sorry.
__label__1	When your news comes from WND, you know it is as good as coming from FOX news, maybe better
__label__-1	I'd recommend giving this post an abortion.
__label__-1	What a POS.
__label__-1	The retard vote is secure!
__label__1	Another voice of reason from the GOP
__label__-1	right to bear arms is not only for hunting animals.
__label__-1	GOP to bill taxpayers for louder PA systems at town halls.
__label__-1	Wow, pretty amazing that Trump gets his daily briefing from Rupert Murdoch and Al-Waleed bin Talal
__label__-1	Corrupt sociopath.
__label__-1	"Lmao, buzzfeed just happened to ""find"" a memo at a hotel, how lucky for then"
__label__-1	If by strong start he means strong start towards destroying the separation of powers, then yes he has gotten off to a strong start.
__label__1	How do we know she's not a secret muslim jihadist infiltrator then?
__label__1	This is definitely a quality that I look for in a president
__label__1	The real issues
__label__-1	This episode of Black Mirror is going too far.
__label__-1	What a slanted headline
__label__1	Well folks, I'm in utter shock I tell ya, utter shock.
__label__1	I think the problem is the stealth voters, will they come out of hiding?
__label__1	B-but Trump and his cabinet have never heard of the term 'actual facts'!
__label__-1	Not really true.
__label__1	but EVERYONE knows that politifact is biased.
__label__1	Dishonest liberal media!
__label__1	"Keep pushing that ""liberals are covering up refugee crimes to keep racists from being proved right"" narrative."
__label__1	Marching orders from putin, he's good to go
__label__1	Clearly he should have cosplayed as a white cliven Bundy supporter.
__label__-1	Why do we even do these things?
__label__-1	Nothing gets by you, Rush.
__label__1	I'm glad the cops have nothing better to do than kick a woman out of the woman's restroom.
__label__1	This just in, R Kelly has agreed to perform at the inauguration.
__label__-1	He was never going to be president anyway
__label__-1	The real truth is that these people treat minorities like pets, telling them what they should and who should they vote for then getting upset when minorities dont do what they want.
__label__-1	Super fucking awesome idea, guys.
__label__-1	For such a conspiracy theory to work, law enforcement also had to be in on it.
__label__1	This won't end badly
__label__-1	Who paid for the Trump bankruptcies?
__label__1	Yes because Republicans have such great fiscal responsibility and sound financial policies.
__label__-1	They should fact check if the FBI requested to interview Mrs Clinton.
__label__-1	Yep, we call that a push poll.
__label__-1	It's ok they just misspoke
__label__-1	All of them but his
__label__-1	My fetish is watching rich people shit on each other, but this time it was for free on TV and I could watch it with my son in the room.
__label__1	I for one, am *shocked*.
__label__-1	As a gun owner, welcome to my world
__label__1	Why should they be expected to pay it back?
__label__1	Her bill disarms citizens and transfers guns to illegals
__label__-1	So that is why there are no threads about Oregon voter fraud.
__label__1	Nothing to see here then, let's move on.
__label__1	Well how else is a man expected to be an expert in something he doesn't partake in?
__label__1	This will, clearly, end well.
__label__-1	Biggest twist in this election so far!
__label__1	He sold away our Internet privacy and slashed budgets for public services across the board, don't forget that!
__label__-1	As well as being an all around piece of shit.
__label__-1	Clintonism has been a failure.
__label__-1	Gotta make it easier for the Russian subs to reach our coast just in case Trump needs to make a quick getaway.
__label__-1	Whoever wins can nominate whomever they like, the nominee still has to get by senate confirmation.
__label__-1	This was probably putins idea to launch a strike on a secondary airbase
__label__1	Yeah, but gay people are icky.
__label__1	That's right here in Indiana we offer our best and brightest!
__label__1	Oh CPAC you dirty censorship loving anti-free speech liberals!
__label__-1	Make Mexico buy us more pants!
__label__-1	"Only three months to turn the White House into a ""mosk"" and the Washington Monument into a minaret."
__label__-1	More accurate description is Bernie Sanders on acid.
__label__1	But remember... gay marriage is about love, not a cheap money grab.
__label__1	Republican know all there is to know about the voter fraud and about the theft of benefits, from their own experience, so we should listen to them.
__label__-1	Well no shit
__label__-1	Thank you Bernie Supporters for handing Trump the election.
__label__1	Thank God that Muslims don't have airplanes.
__label__-1	Whats wrong with the sight?
__label__1	How can they afford the MASSIVE CORPORATE TAX BREAKS, if they have to hand out money to unemployed peons.
__label__-1	In related news, sky blue, water wet, Palin retarded.

__label__-1	ITT: bunches of Bernie fanbois Is that refuse to hear both sides to the coin.
__label__-1	Volunteer Military.
__label__1	If it doesn't include a alien culture wiping out both coasts ala Independence Day, it is not realistic.
__label__1	This should be fun for everyone who isn't a billionaire.
__label__1	Really, no one has noticed.
__label__1	Seems like an unbiased and totally reasonable source to me.
__label__1	America deserves better than the prosperity of the 90s pitted against the clusterfuck of the 2000s so lets lump Clinton and Bush together!
__label__-1	Leave Her Highness Princess Ivanka alone!
__label__1	Too Soon
__label__-1	This idiots inflated ego, Will now get popped publicly.
__label__-1	Funny because a lot of HBCU's predate Jim Crow laws.
__label__-1	You know I bet if Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingram, and all the other conservative pundits just disappeared conservative supporters wouldn't have anything to say.
__label__1	With a headline like that, who wouldn't take this article seriously?
__label__1	The must really make the Bernie Sanders supporters upset that Clinton is committed to a liberal Supreme Court.
__label__-1	People act like this is crazy, but really you just need to convince two men they're better off falling in line: McConnell and Ryan.
__label__1	Bernie moneybags sanders.
__label__1	Because Assange has absolutely nothing to gain from this.
__label__-1	Are they *trying* to spark armed insurrection?
__label__-1	True!
__label__-1	So is this good for weed?
__label__1	Shocking
__label__-1	"""Because the bible tells me so...."""
__label__1	And nope don't come to rainy oregon either- this place sucks
__label__1	LOL THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL &amp; THOSE SITE ARE FULL OF RIGGED FAKE NEWS
__label__1	Why wouldn't everyone want the nice G-men to have access to all their personal info?
__label__-1	Considering the timing and Manning's connection to wikileaks, maybe they're trying to influence Assange by torturing his accomplice.
__label__1	I DEFFINITELY believe you.
__label__-1	"""right now the focus is putting Americans back to work"" amid lowest-unemployment numbers in years."
__label__1	Putin defending Trump, well that's a surprise
__label__1	clearly a paid shill
__label__1	Just another example of Obama's respect for the rule of law.
__label__-1	Strange how that happens.
__label__-1	These polls are stupid
__label__1	So basically we should just privatize everything and make it a for profit business?
__label__-1	Corporations actually produce something and employ people.
__label__-1	"I love how ""state's rights"" conservatives are waging this war."
__label__-1	And Clinton must disclose her pro-Saudi Arabia ties.
__label__-1	when we laugh about the dead and the suffered I conclude comedy is nothing but tragedy plus time.
__label__-1	I would love to see how the liberals would react it the situation was reversed.
__label__-1	Good news for Clinton supporters
__label__-1	That's not a tradition thing, that's an ethics thing
__label__-1	I'm willing to bet that a poll of FOX viewers would show 'Islam' as the main reason for this terror.
__label__1	Wow, total psych, cause there ain't no body that speaks both languages and will be able to tell.
__label__-1	Stay classy Cleveland, you fucking shithole of a city.
__label__-1	Ohhhh, now I understand.
__label__1	It's nice to see completely unbiased articles
__label__-1	That's true, we all deserve better than Bush, a person who's not even declared his candidacy and it's already dead in the water.
__label__-1	Why the down vote?
__label__-1	It'll be interesting to see what the intelligence community, a group that has been badmouthed by the admin and betrayed by the house intelligence chair, does if they dig up enough evidence of wrongdoing against this administration and the GOP congress continues with a cover up instead of going after the president.
__label__-1	There are very few people in prison for just simple possession.
__label__-1	They'll be released at 4pm October 7th
__label__-1	Wow, it's almost like he's a big fucking liar.
__label__-1	Oh I can play this game: CLIMATE CHANGE is the BENGHAZI of the ENVIRONMENT STEM CELL RESEARCH is the SOLYNDRA of BIOLOGY The DODD-FRANK ACT is the SAME-SEX-MARRIAGE of BANKING

__label__1	Seems like a reasonable gentleman.
__label__-1	bring it on socialist, bring it on.
__label__-1	This makes me feel lonely and sad
__label__-1	Seriously, they're nearly as bad as the Obama Boys of 08, amirite?
__label__-1	Man, that upset me more than it should
__label__-1	Watch'em circle the drain!
__label__1	The voice of the people has spoken again.
__label__-1	Except that the Democrats are the ones who are talking reality while the Republicans are still denying that climate change is happening, supporting economic policies that have caused multiple recessions, trying to give the military more money after they've already said that they don't need any more funding, pandering to religious fundamentalists, and wanting to cut services to those that need them most
__label__1	Let's take his advice and nuke ISIS.
__label__1	Hmm, glad to have this stunning insight from Rush Limbaugh's Myspace page.
__label__1	I KNEW IT!
__label__-1	America responds to Obama that he should be ashamed to have not lived up to a single campaign promise, care more about terrorists in other countries than the citizens of his own, and placing gun control over education in his concerns of state.
__label__-1	the Don is slowly but surely outmaneuvering all the other gop contestants there can only be one, and he is the Don
__label__1	Yes, let's call the whole thing off and anoint Clinton after ~1/4 of the country has weighed in.
__label__1	Joe did a great job stumping for McCain, I'm sure Trump is pumped about this endorsement
__label__-1	Just wait til everyone hears about the ax he is running with: proposal to cut the federal budget by 43% was his plan in 2012
__label__1	Clearly he was just joking.
__label__1	Yea but that's just taxpayer money
__label__1	I am shocked, just shocked.
__label__-1	Also no nsa hackerman fisa warrants
__label__1	He must be anti-semetic
__label__1	Well, maybe they should just stop being poor.
__label__1	Maybe because they don't look the part.
__label__-1	LOL Less than that if you count in the 4 faithless electors.
__label__-1	Lies.
__label__1	To be fair, then we'd be even for saving them in WW2.
__label__-1	I meant debate, not election :).
__label__-1	IT HAS BEEN FORETOLD BY THE GODS.
__label__1	Wow, after only 300 posts about this the past days I had no idea!
__label__1	It's that pesky activist volunteer military who should stop talking and focus on their work
__label__1	Cummings probably canceled the meeting because he was busy dodging bullets in the inner city where he lives.
__label__1	Oh, this should go well.
__label__-1	Here's a better idea: stop supporting Trump's shitty ideas and appointees.
__label__1	Worst thing to happen since 9/11
__label__-1	Yea Right
__label__-1	So the solution is.....more guns?
__label__-1	Obvious attempt at damage control.
__label__1	Guns don't kill people.
__label__-1	Except real income has increased
__label__-1	ITT: Hurr Durr drain the swamp
__label__1	Nice way to keep the FBI independent of political pressure after Hoover.
__label__-1	I am pretty skeptical that experts know what the fuck they are ever taking about.
__label__1	Yuengling is made very close to DC, maybe the owner just knows that a Trump white house would cause a lot more alcohol consumption in and around the capitol?
__label__-1	I don't want any of these guys.
__label__1	Yeah, damn rape police enforcing the law
__label__1	It likely wasn't But the primary was
__label__1	O rly?
__label__1	Business Insider A hotbed of fake news!
__label__-1	it's honestly just so-so
__label__1	What we really need is a Church of America with The Donald as its infallible spiritual leader.
__label__-1	Apparently you don't know anything about Bernie.
__label__1	Good thing Clinton didn't get elected, I heard she's a real warmonger
__label__-1	If you're not voting for Hillary Clinton, you're a conservative, and easily in the dumber half of all Americans that have ever lived.
__label__-1	Honest question: how old are you?
__label__1	Thanks, I've been waiting for the financial industry to weigh in before making up my mind, because they have my best interests at heart.
__label__1	That seems like a perfectly stable and rational thing to do
__label__1	Safety pins, thanks Richard Hell, maybe the punk style will come back.
__label__1	Will they disavow?
__label__-1	Least disturbing thing about Ben Carson.
__label__1	Curse you LIBERAL MEDIA.
__label__-1	Speaking of that, when is As-Seen-On-TV going to issue toilet paper with Trump on it?
__label__-1	"Man, I'm really starting to like ""I don't have to get elected again"" Obama."
__label__1	I did NOT see that coming
__label__1	"throw up another W for ""the real americans"""
__label__-1	Not a Republican, but most Dems I know are uneducated when it pertains to the constitution, diplomacy and economics.
__label__-1	They're on to college certs now.
__label__1	I guess that's what people loved about Bernie, that he just wanted to bomb the shit out of everybody.
__label__-1	I think Mississippi may win the first ever state-wide Darwin Award!
__label__1	I love one party, right wing governments!
__label__-1	can someone please just stop with all the news I am chafing here
__label__-1	Has nothing to do with politics.
__label__-1	What a despicable human being.
__label__1	They actually work for George Soros
__label__-1	People who have researched these things, how much does this resemble someone on a really gnarly coke binge?
__label__-1	If you thought there is any difference between the two parties... Common people time to vote these cunts out
__label__-1	Whether you like or dislike Trump, he has a point here.
__label__-1	It's cause those 57% were done by Muslims
__label__1	"""I can see Syria from my front porch, it is Iran's path to the sea"""
__label__-1	cognitive dissonance?
__label__-1	I feel like there will be a shutdown
__label__1	shhh, don't you know that the AR stands for assault rifle!
__label__1	I think someone doesn't understand fiat money.
__label__1	Just remember...President Obama is only nominating someone as a political stunt and has absolutely nothing to do with governing the country.
__label__1	Definitely not fascism.
__label__-1	From what I understand, a High-School senior doesn't have compulsory attendance to high-school (depending on the state, not sure about Mississippi), so what the hell was the truancy officer doing trying to corral them?
__label__-1	So is this why they want to make weed illegal in the states it's legal?
__label__-1	Even if he did want Medicare for all it would be a miracle for Congress to pass that.
__label__-1	The fact that anybody is going to vote for EITHER candidate is the proof that America is dumbed down.
__label__1	Florida, the bastion of logic as far as states go.
__label__1	"He misspelled ""resignation"""
__label__-1	Yes, please, Mr President, please go to Cuba and normalize relations.
__label__1	I hope they investigate who is leaking this information.
__label__1	People are so harsh towards first ladies recently.
__label__-1	Psychotropic drugs.
__label__-1	Even the lizard I follow on instagram handled his beef with snoop dogg better than our president
__label__-1	They just want a fair and balanced debate, Hillary.
__label__-1	trump has the most pathetic fragile ego.. i bet he threw a few temper tantrums when he realized Obama was way more popular than he will ever be.
__label__-1	It's not if there was no relevant legal proceeding at the time it was destroyed.
__label__-1	Glad our tax money was wasted on this non-issue.
__label__1	Scientific polls are lies!
__label__1	Yea I bet she came up with that tweet herself
__label__-1	We've got to bash the fash
__label__-1	Expert
__label__-1	Just my observation with respect to Isreal, nothing more.
__label__-1	"Gosh, it's like these ""news"" sites aren't really interested in reporting what goes on in the world so much as forwarding their own petty, vindictive agenda!"
__label__1	Yup.. the ACA is failing just like CNN, The New York Times, Vanity Fair and Snoop Dog.. So sad
__label__1	Small Government FTW!
__label__-1	Which swamp was Trump supposed to drain, again?
__label__-1	So take it off schedule 1.
__label__-1	The city council should vote to change the city's name to 'Putingrad' every time Trump visits and vote to change it back every time he leaves.
__label__-1	Hmmm... a social conservative and a fiscal liberal.
__label__1	But remember, Hillary not hitting BCC when sending emails is way worse than this
__label__-1	Still better than Trump.
__label__-1	Another scumball move from the Tea Party House of Reps.
__label__1	those evil, good for nothing corporations are just trying to maximize profits!
__label__-1	I agree.
__label__-1	Do you have any stock holdings?
__label__1	I'm sure sure we just don't have the full context of the situation.
__label__1	If home bound seniors want to eat they have to earn it just like the rest of us!
__label__-1	How do they all fit in the basement?
__label__-1	As opposed to the neo-nazi scum they've been scuffling with?
__label__-1	Likely automatic stabilizers winding down as the economy winds up - it's a pretty clear match to the crisis and recovery.
__label__1	I can't wait to see this story and all its details from cable's number one news network, Fox News.
__label__1	Cause that will prevent the clintons
__label__1	Because facts matter to these people.
__label__-1	Voting machines should be 100% open source.
__label__1	Just so everyone knows, he is really a Republican because Republicans the only ones who are completely corrupt.
__label__1	And that 60 vote rule comes back to bite its creator in the ass.
__label__1	I thought Hillary was against stand your ground.
__label__1	In other news: people with well-stocked pantries and refrigerators less hungry than those with little to no food.
__label__-1	I would love to hear how you're gonna do that when you're on social security
__label__1	Does Kansas have a million people?
__label__-1	Just call it exactly what it is: Republicare
__label__-1	I'm willing to agree it's a problem, but I will not support censorship which seems to be the only thing that is being proposed as a solution.
__label__1	For the militias to be able to hunt under government orders, obviously.
__label__-1	I would like to sell a bridge to the other 40%.
__label__1	This is obviously the best way to cut down on wastage in government.
__label__1	How can it possibly be that this intelligent, sweet woman **lives alone**?
__label__1	But they might not be quite willing for the diaper changes that would be necessary, many old Republican supporters now needing those services for themselves.
__label__-1	To the third page with you!
__label__-1	It's getting harder and harder to empathize with the proud, misunderstood Trump voter when his apparatchiks can't even give them the baseline horrific things that they want.
__label__1	I wonder why
__label__-1	The thing about the cia is that they are very patient.
__label__-1	Bribery deserves Privacy
__label__1	Well, I mean Ben did choose to be black.
__label__-1	So basically like any celebrity?
__label__-1	"I thought their politi""fact"" group already did that?"
__label__-1	I wonder how many iPhones that can buy.
__label__1	I am still waiting for them to come for my guns
__label__1	If only he was a thrice divorced adulterous reality star who bragged about sexual assault.
__label__1	It's just a character trait of alpha males.
__label__-1	"""I never thought face-eating leopards would eat MY face,"" says woman who voted for the Face-Eating Leopard Party candidate."
__label__-1	Damn dog, If you can't keep the Fox viewership happy as a Republican you are fucking up Bigly.
__label__-1	Fuck you fuckstick
__label__1	Yes, we can't blame the leader of our government for any government involvement with prevention or cleanup of this catastrophe ... because there was no government involvement.
__label__-1	This ain't new.
__label__1	Sounds like Russia needs to build a wall and ban all Muslims
__label__1	But if he dodged the Vietnam draft and supported Obama he'd be a hero for following his conscience
__label__-1	Too bad about the flag.
__label__-1	Named after Benito Juarez of Mexico.
__label__-1	As long as the Washington liberals keep trying to take my Guns, the teaparty are correct.
__label__-1	Are we now allowing multiple posts a day from SuperPAC sites?
__label__-1	Hey McCain, Trump isn't going to let facts get in the way of this one, you're going to have to do a little more than send mildly worded letters that he isn't going to read.
__label__1	But she doesn't look sick, she's fine, slap her on the ass and tell her to suck it up.
__label__1	It's gona kill small business!
__label__1	NSA surveillance has thwarted sooo many ISIS acts.
__label__1	Marijuana is only bad when minorities smoke it...
__label__1	I'm sure Wells Fargo will pay for their crimes and actions under a Trump administration.
__label__-1	"So do we then ""liberate"" North Carolina under the pretext of humanitarian aid?"
__label__1	Oops, was that not supposed to be shared?
__label__-1	If anything he seems adverse to it
__label__1	If you remember, Democrats tried to rush the bill through over the course of one year, by not holding frequent debates for that time including by not relying on the unreliable CBO for information every step of the way.
__label__-1	He knows more than the general's.
__label__1	Oh yeah, this policy will totally stand up in court!
__label__-1	"""Betsy DeVos has spent nearly three decades of her life, tens of millions of dollars, and considerable personal energy toward one noble goal: ensuring that poor children trapped in failing schools have the same opportunities that wealthy and middle-class kids already have,"" Toomey I bet that 60k from her family had something to do with that statement."
__label__-1	Maybe the IRS gives a shit that he doesn't pay taxes.
__label__1	Yeah, the Bernie Bros really hate her because of God, Gays, and Guns alright.
__label__-1	Don't undersell this: H.R.1275 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): **World's Greatest Healthcare Plan** of 2017 - POTUS
__label__1	Deregulate lemonade stands!
__label__1	And they have sooooo much to be angry about.
__label__-1	It is the holy Trinity of the christian GOP - Fear, Hate, Bigotry.
__label__-1	This is just blatantly untrue, but OK
__label__-1	Maybe they should have thought about that before rigging elections and using the media as their party propaganda arm.
__label__1	"Cuban's just bitter that his Apprentice clone, ""The Benefactor"", was shit."
__label__-1	A surprisingly positive ad.
__label__1	This doesn't support the idea that Clinton in unelectable, don't vote away!
__label__1	Yeah I mean it's totally better to be a bunch of ignorant sheeple who are stupid enough to think that the establishment government has their best interests in mind and would never, ever do something so crooked as rig an election or try to cover up crimes
__label__-1	The anti-Citizens United folks are sorely confused now.
__label__-1	This is enough to arrest him right?
__label__-1	Didn't ask for sand(y) bags and now they're surprised the flood is a problem?
__label__-1	Many foods contain Arsenic.
__label__1	Just like the polls before the vote
__label__1	I, for one, am shocked and appalled.
__label__-1	This should be a front of the news story that Trump has to answer to.
__label__1	I'm sure it will all sort itself out once the insurers can cross state lines.
__label__-1	Ding, we have a winner.
__label__-1	I can't imagine the media shitshow that would ensue if they successfully impeached a SECOND Clinton.
__label__-1	TIL Donald Trump doesn't know that Hawaii is part of the US.
__label__1	I guess that amazing speech was mostly half true... So Presidential
__label__1	but the reason these states are so unhealthy, and so poor, is partly due to obamacare!
__label__1	How do you expect them to get off their lazy asses and work, if they're not hungry?
__label__1	Thats insulting
__label__-1	Both Joe and Eugene.
__label__-1	Ethics are for libsss.
__label__1	color me srprised
__label__1	I'm sure New Hampshire and Vermont must be a blood bath due to having the most lax gun laws in the country.
__label__-1	But...but..only the left is intolerant and violent The_Donald
__label__-1	It pays to be a friend of Obama, that's for sure.
__label__-1	His weekly paycheck.
__label__-1	So who is going to jail?
__label__-1	Apparently the swamp is hard to drain.
__label__1	yes becuase trump needs money
__label__1	So, they finally found that 4chan hacker guy I keep hearing about?
__label__1	What an amazing story.
__label__1	Oh wow I'm so excited for the ability to have no control over how much I donate!
__label__-1	You'd think a spoiled rich kid would be a better liar
__label__-1	Gotta love how everything needs to be fact checked now but during rallies trump would read wikileaks emails as being the absolute truth.
__label__1	I forgot that Hillary, not Comey, made the decision not to recommend charges being brought.
__label__1	He was just testing the system to see how broken it was.
__label__1	Big news in the next two minutes!
__label__1	Soros is running out of cash.
__label__-1	$hill must be chocking on all that bull sh!t she has been spewing on campaign
__label__-1	But honestly, how else are you supposed to run a dictatorship?
__label__-1	But what is the myth?
__label__1	It isn't true until it's verified by Fox News and Limbaugh.
__label__-1	That's good to hear, but we should still turn out to vote in the midterm elections to hammer that extra nail in their political coffin.
__label__1	Just what the Republican party needs to deal with their lack of enthusiasm for any of the current candidates.
__label__-1	Seriously, Russell Crowe looks nothing like Leonardo DiCaprio
__label__-1	It's funny how everybody like to cite the CBO on everything when it bolsters their agenda, but completely ignore it when it doesn't.
__label__-1	Fear, hate, god and guns.
__label__-1	Trump doesnt care.
__label__1	Louisiana I get that you need us to focus on your problems, but #allstatesmatter
__label__1	Let's just take the lying murdering dictators word on this shall we?
__label__-1	Wow you sure do make the exact same comment in dozens of Hillary threads over and over and over again.
__label__-1	I don't feel very hostile...
__label__1	Yea the border wall around Israel totally was a complete failure.
__label__-1	Wow, you can count on this not seeing the light of day :/
__label__1	everybody knows i only stereotype other races and genders when im excited!
__label__1	Yea and the solution is to get rid of the politicians who are bought and sold by businesses and put the businessman who has been greasing their pockets in charge...just get rid of the middleman basically.
__label__1	This is so new, Nixon used little riots as a regular part of his campaign appearances.
__label__1	If this nation wants rich people then our citizens should do it the old fashion way, inherit it, like Trump.
__label__1	Yeah, we could use train subsidies to ship them off to camps!
__label__1	Who needs classified briefings or other intelligence reports when you have Breitbart to give you the real facts.
__label__-1	liberal tears
__label__-1	It got pepper-sprayed
__label__-1	If I recall from the last thread, every gas station in the town is owned by the same person, and they use their monopoly to gouge everyone.
__label__-1	Let's just get straight to the punchline, they did indeed kill him right?
__label__-1	That's the end of Newsome as a useful politician.
__label__-1	Of course and all Americans ( 99%) will go broke because of this will he laughs his way to the bank.
__label__1	I like Bernie, I just don't think he could win.
__label__1	Polls have been extremely reliable as of late so I'm taking this one to the bank.
__label__1	"With that sort of attitude and system of values you could hardly consider them ""real"" Americans."
__label__1	Yeah, better go investigate Benghazi again.... I'm sure you'll turn up something this time!
__label__1	Damn politics content is really getting better.
__label__-1	Anyone who votes for the wall funding loses their seat, it's just like people who voted for the Iraq war... it's cancer.
__label__1	To be fair, I think he's talking genuine attacks, not ones prefabricated by him and his friends.
__label__-1	Party of Trump, Bernie-or-Busters.
__label__1	Obvi you cut taxes on wealthy people further!
__label__1	I bet those 10 votes MASSIVELY turned that election in her favor.
__label__-1	Water: wet.
__label__1	Sounds like Obama is an evil bigot who needs to check his privilege.
__label__-1	I dont trust the rhetoric from the unproven serial liar trump
__label__-1	the thought of two penises near each other makes fred very....very excited.
__label__1	Don't buy the narrative they want you to believe sheeple!
__label__-1	They never cease to amaze me.
__label__1	but but but fox and brietbart are great.
__label__1	Damn Northern Aggression.
__label__-1	Ah, yes, I was waiting for the blowhards to grandstand when this came down...what a farce.
__label__1	If I want news I go to an unbiased source, Itar Tass from Russia comes to mind or Xinhua from China.
__label__1	Gee, that was convincing.
__label__-1	GrC is getting a lot of positive attention lately.
__label__1	That's how you become President of *all* Americans.
__label__-1	Did he really do it this time....FBI said they got nothing.
__label__1	Right, that's exactly why trump won 2939 out of 3102 counties in the US- because rural America isn't riding the Trump train.
__label__1	That damn UN, always conspiring to take America down!
__label__-1	I wonder how long he will be around before he's assassinated for all of his good ideas?
__label__-1	And six months later a new a System of a Down album will drop.
__label__1	I thought Barron was off limits
__label__-1	if this is what you believe then there is no reason to listen or talk to a Republican...I mean a party willing to do that...will do anything.
__label__1	Obviously that means that the NSA only makes reasonable, lawful requests.
__label__1	Oh I disagree he just better not be caught hugging an African American President.
__label__-1	So, should we do away with divorce and force the parents to stay together until the child is at least 18?
__label__1	I am terrified of Trump because he said Bruce Jenner instead of Caitlyn Jenner.
__label__1	Let's not jump to conclusions until all the online polls are factored in!
__label__-1	Trump rally is at its end with the realization of the Trump reality.
__label__1	Because nothing is more alpha than running down wolves to the point of exhaustion from a helicopter and then shooting them
__label__-1	Ugh...this title is just bad.
__label__-1	"""transparent"""
__label__1	"""We're not making weapons, trust us""."
__label__1	What a hero.
__label__1	Yes, we need another war to jump in because we're doing so well elsewhere.
__label__1	But this will provide America with much needed jobs!
__label__1	But heroin's really cheap now.
__label__1	Must be all them gun laws working.
__label__1	It's nice to see the enlightened commentors here offering constructive solutions to this problem and not simply contributing to it.
__label__-1	What!
__label__1	Thanks Obama!
__label__1	Crooked Hillary must've bought them all off!
__label__1	What, CPAC won't stand for free speech?
__label__-1	You're on it today bravo

__label__-1	I read the title as 'pirate prision' article wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be

__label__-1	ITT: Trump supporters who think railing against one of the most successful presidents will help out.
__label__-1	The terrorists won years ago, we've been living in a state of terror for 11 years now
__label__-1	I can't take someone who thinks it's been 12 years since 1995 seriously.
__label__-1	How can it be legal as a political figure to send an e-mail blast that is full of such patently false information?
__label__1	Please say no more, I want to solve it myself.
__label__-1	I'm sure that's an exact quote.
__label__-1	Welcome to the plutocracy
__label__-1	But...Obama went to Hawaii!
__label__-1	What does this have to do with this post?
__label__-1	Rip in pepperonis Roger Stone
__label__-1	Jesus didn't fucking exist
__label__1	stop oppressing my freedom of religion!
__label__1	Why would any of these red blooded Americans want to go to that socialist hell hole up north?
__label__-1	Could CNN sue Trump for defamation?
__label__-1	Nothing good.
__label__-1	"Really tired of seeing ""Could"" in these news articles."
__label__1	Gotta love how stable the middle east has become!
__label__-1	Trump legitimately has thought of himself as Hugh Hefner's equal his entire life
__label__1	I love when the real problems people are facing are finally addressed
__label__1	"Yeah, I remember when Bernie called people of color ""super-predators"", condemned gay marriage, and intimidated his spouse's sexual assault victims."
__label__-1	Anyone but Hilldog.
__label__1	Whats wrong with that?
__label__1	his defining moment
__label__1	Silly Redditor, terrorism is only done by brown people!
__label__-1	This was not a politically smart move.
__label__-1	Fine then if trump dosnt like the constitution.. he is free to give up his US citizenship and get the fuck out of this country along with anyone else who supports this position
__label__-1	Because Ivy League schools are being flooded with Asian Asians?
__label__1	I only listen to the weather channel when it tells me my weather forecast
__label__-1	first they give us the work, then they throw us in jail

__label__-1	At least they learned something in public school.
__label__-1	Bernie Sanders walked to work one day and dropped a Milky Way wrapper in a municipal garbage can, which caused a subtle shift in the direction of the wind that day that caused Eric Garner to draw *just* little enough breath such that he died!

__label__1	He's tearing the guns from our hands
__label__-1	All of the local news articles fail to mention the word GOP or Republican for some reason.

__label__1	Slow news day, great time to release this.
__label__1	Don't you see, it worked.
__label__-1	Dunno about you all, but I know who I'm not voting for next year.
__label__1	Yup universal care is like universal basic income: it looks good on paper but no country has ever implemented it and no country wants to be the guinea pig in an experiment and go first.
__label__1	Yes, because other issues were felt to be of more importance and the organization has limited resources he *must* be full of shit.
__label__1	If having to get fingerprinted and agree to having a background check performed on you just to volunteer with the Veterans Affairs, surely not having the proper qualifications to be listed on the state's health insurance website is constitutional.
__label__-1	If you stop buying iPhones you'll be fine don't worry about it.

__label__-1	A lot cheaper than hiring a lawyer, I guess.
__label__1	Breaking News: Congress also planning to defund the nation's universities as a result of the handful of shootings.
__label__-1	I bet this is negatively correlated with quality of education
__label__-1	Not a Trump supporter, but I imagine they will say that it's not corrupt; the Democrats are being crybabies and are trying to undermine Trump's administration, so this is the only way to get around it
__label__-1	Dope user name
__label__-1	"13:45... effing awesome, ""Get the f off my phone""."
__label__1	Only a true visionary like Rmoney can sense what his audience wants and give it to them.

__label__-1	A medieval solution to a non-existent problem.
__label__1	Yeah, but my feelings are hurt, so I'm not going to vote!
__label__-1	Including a condescending tweet from a man who did his best to put weapons on the streets of Mexico and America is the height of irony
__label__-1	Another corrupt Democrat.
__label__-1	they didn't spell it wrong, they used an alternative-spelling.

__label__-1	If you've never had your face melted by an 11 ton thermobaric explosive, you haven't experienced true freedom.

__label__1	Another red letter day in the GOP minority outreach program.
__label__-1	Yet more sabotage.
__label__-1	The smart ones know better than to take that job.
__label__-1	Only because they don't have enough guns, apparently, according to the theory of more guns equals more safety
__label__-1	We are not going to stop asking for it though buckle up buckaroo.
__label__1	YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO FEMINISM AND IDENTITY POLITICS!

__label__-1	Yep the 1% is shaking in their boots
__label__1	Yeah dont they always
__label__-1	Got tired of winning after election
__label__-1	Although this might be a decent idea on its own merits, everyone knows the only reason why Obama is pushing this is to register more Democrat voters.
__label__1	I'm sure he'd say the same thing about Chelsea running the Clinton Foundation in he reverse scenario.
__label__1	They should have had a sign on the door that said gun free zone
__label__1	Good thing we have a Congress that listens to the people.

__label__1	obama's gonna take our guns... but for real this time
__label__-1	Probably an endorsement from the Indiana governor.
__label__1	I mean he is responsible for Katrina, 9/11, and faking the moon landing.
__label__-1	Hungry people dont stay hungry for long.
__label__-1	It's more like Obama is better for **his** business.
__label__1	You can't prove that the media didn't cover up a terrorist attack!
__label__1	How surprising that the neo-nazi doesn't like the left-wing Jew.
__label__-1	As someone who doesn't watch much of the TV news... are they still all sucking Bachmann's dick, or is she seen as irrelevant now?
__label__1	Yeah like that unfair media bias against Hitler.
__label__-1	Lets hear it for the CIA, working since their inception to make the world less safe, and to short sightedly screw the US over.
__label__1	Yeah, you got a real Zapruder moment there.
__label__1	Because Dylan Roof was a leftist.

__label__1	Both parties are the same!
__label__-1	Not sure why Iowa thinks being the first to vote in the primary is something to be proud of, when that state is the Harbinger of Failure.
__label__1	I bet this will go over *great* with the military.

__label__1	"It's actually the bill to ""Save American Workers *From* Healthcare""."
__label__1	Yeah but at the same time Putin is making them hard
__label__1	This case will likely be thrown out because of the mandatory arbitration clauses in everyone's contract which the Supreme Court so wisely upheld.
__label__-1	By all means, arrest them both then.
__label__-1	Well, given the choice between a soundbite-happy, somewhat misguided candidate who thinks we shouldn't fight wars unless totally necessary, and a soundbite-happy tremendously misguided candidate who thinks going to war against a sovereign country who never attacked us is a worthwhile pursuit, I'll take the former every time.
__label__1	Well if Morning Joe didn't cover them then how could he be expected to tweet about them?
__label__-1	Looks like they didn't put much thought or work into the bill.
__label__-1	Pope is catholic - most fundamentalist Christian denominations in America consider Catholics to be crazy and in some cases not even real Christians - so I highly doubt the pope having much influence here, Catholics are not the bulk of this particular problem

__label__1	Oh wanger banger, you paid Obama shill, you.
__label__1	Intelligent comments in here so far
__label__1	Well, NO ONE can DOUBT his EXPERIENCE in the drug trade!
__label__1	Yeah but it's OK because she prayed for forgiveness each time.
__label__1	Yeah 2000 was a great one too!
__label__1	big banks and corporations own this country, these whiny laborers need to know their place
__label__1	Best way to cause unity if you ask me
__label__1	According to my local abstinence-only program, this is what happen when people use condoms.
__label__-1	Curious how this looks when adjusted for inflation.
__label__1	Finally, those FEMA camps that conservative's swore Obama was going to use to round them up are going to be put to good use.
__label__-1	They are not giving her that money out of the kindness of their hearts.
__label__-1	What motherfuckers.
__label__1	When 1% of the people own 99% of the wealth life will still be tolerable and the people will still be able to get what they need, because the wealth of one man doesn't take away from the purchasing power of the others.
__label__-1	So why are we still funding this?
__label__1	She and Goldman Sachs Goldwater Girl are going to bring about Wall Street Reform .... it's going to be epic
__label__1	This just gets better and better.
__label__1	"They're probably getting ready to make an arrest in the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy."
__label__1	I never realize a few miles of rope could solve most of our problems

__label__-1	Probably, but those briefings are really long and boring, so IDK enough to confirm our deny this.
__label__-1	Got to pitch for that Koch money.
__label__1	Drain the swamp!
__label__-1	My favorite part, where trump gets to talk about nothing and looks like a moron
__label__-1	"""Leading State Sponsor Terrorism"" Is that Gulf state dick so far up the daily callers ass they can't see past the red sea?"
__label__-1	His speech certainly sounded a lot of anti-semitic dogwhistles, so it's not surprising that this happened.
__label__-1	Correcting intensifies.
__label__-1	No proof he's sold his stake in DAPL either.
__label__1	Remember Americans: If we get rid of Immigrants rape will cease to exist.
__label__1	it was easy, they were all counted when they registered to vote for hillary clinton in the states she needed it the least
__label__-1	Sure, they say that, then run through a field covered in bear traps and mines and tell the Dems they have to sign documents over on the other side.
__label__-1	This will surely be the winning strike from the Left.
__label__-1	or don't care as long as they have food on their hands and sports in front of them.
__label__1	We need smart guns that read a person's intent and mood and automatically won't fire.
__label__-1	The Imperial President strikes again.
__label__1	Dang right, we need MORE guns, everywhere, all the time.
__label__1	Well reasoned, rational thing to say.
__label__1	Well, that question seems perfectly unbiased and doesn't generally lend itself towards one result
__label__-1	No they care more about abusing their ^^^^slaves workers than about playing soccer.
__label__1	Health care for the masses is secondary to assuring that the rich get even richer.
__label__1	Yeah fuck the next generation!
__label__1	The free market will fix it.

__label__-1	*sachs
__label__-1	How smart.
__label__1	Comey better watch out for gym equipment.
__label__-1	Ha whatever, Im sure theyd let us know.
__label__1	This is kind of remarkable considering his campaign manager worked directly for Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin puppet in Ukraine, and was directly involved in Russian-Ukrainian relations.
__label__1	But Hillary is the elitist.
__label__1	I'm sure his life will be extremely difficult now.
__label__-1	"Trump: ""I did business with Iranian bank tied to terrorism, I'm smart."""
__label__1	Easy: They're going to have the gender identity police do the enforcement.
__label__1	"""obviously its because he's already made America SO great ALREADY that he doesn't need as many intelligence briefings, you snowflakes!!!!11!"""
__label__1	I've looked at this blog's articles and see no apparent bias
__label__1	So death panels without the useless bureaucratic overhead of the panels?
__label__1	20 years later she finally responds That's a great leader for you!
__label__-1	today, Paddy Power not honoring their 10/1 line of 'The Popular Vote Winner to lose the Election' for more than 7.5 EUR.. this after paying early on Clinton win due to 'one way traffic'.. not even 50 EUR will they take as a bet - trader's decision - we are well within our legal right, etc.. complete false advertisement bullshit as they keep their line on the site but decline any bet higher than 7.5 EUR.
__label__1	60 out of about 2500... Wow just awful
__label__1	Give them more money, they've been so amazingly effective
__label__1	They will need to finish the audit of it first.
__label__1	Yeah... I guess we should just abandon social services altogether and let those markets magically solve all our societal problems.
__label__1	Because Trump rugged the primaries.
__label__1	It's just because they love the babbys so much!
__label__1	Well fuck minorities build the wall and bomb Mecca!
__label__-1	"Perhaps he knows and knows that when the truth is revealed we will know that the legitimacy of his election is even further diminished from his present status as just another ""Runner Up!"""
__label__-1	Are mixed marriages illegal also?
__label__1	Just what the working class needs!
__label__1	Right, but has anyone considered that this violates the Non-Aggression Principle?
__label__-1	Trump is the best.
__label__-1	Branding opportunity.
__label__-1	But we could have cut 523 social services instead of giving up having a really cool airplane with 5 engines!
__label__1	Some signed the petition early and often!
__label__-1	Shows why we love her so much.
__label__1	This is sure to go well.
__label__-1	Hah, awesome.
__label__-1	"Lets make ""thanks trump"" a thing"
__label__1	Well the world will sit and wait for donnie to play catch up.
__label__1	He didn't *intend* to , tho
__label__1	His respect for women is the best
__label__-1	Is it correct like your election predictions?
__label__-1	So the man who lied under oath about wiretapping ALL AMERICANS comes out to claim he didn't wiretap one specific person or building and we're supposed to believe that?

__label__1	Remember only the Clintons are crooked.
__label__-1	"The Penguin calls Gotham PD torture report ""full of crap.. Awwwwwk"" and claims Joker knew of the tactics the whole time."

__label__-1	You mean the guys you did a photo-op with recently John?
__label__1	Still Obama's fault!
__label__1	Nobody saw that coming
__label__-1	I think we could probably get a 100 to 0 vote against, hey senator did we mention the pipeline was running right over your property?

__label__-1	"""...(the resolution) would **steel** need to pass the legislature..."" You're fuckin up again, Buzzfeed."
__label__-1	Hillary is kicking them out as fast as she can.
__label__1	Wow this is surprising.
__label__-1	Suck it Ryan
__label__1	Yeah but FDR was a Democrat so who really gives a shit?
__label__-1	Translation: We're going to make the government weak and allow it to be privatized to the hilt with the guise of giving power back to the people because businesses are people.
__label__-1	Hush money.
__label__1	Well jesus was a big supporter of torture so it's probably no one in the conservative party
__label__1	You guys but Ohio is going to turn red anyways so why does it matter anyways omg.
__label__-1	It also states that the machines switched Obama for Romney.......looks like the tag line takes the cake though.
__label__-1	the president of USA cannot tell the truth, wants all of the responsibility of running a country with non of the responsibility of running a country when things go bad from all the lying, wheres the country going to be in 4 years with nothing buts lies and laying blame game coming from this admin.
__label__1	Well since America and the UK are exactly the same, the otherwise crazy article makes a good point!
__label__1	You're not rich or else you would understand.
__label__-1	I'm expecting a perfectly calm reaction to this on his twitter account.
__label__-1	All I took from this post is that paragraphs are hard.
__label__1	But at least it doesn't cover abortion
__label__-1	To be fair, if tomorrow Donald Trump orders the National Guard to practice an exercise spanning half the country, I'd flip my shit.
__label__-1	Yeah, explain this to your anti-NAFTA base, Donald.
__label__-1	JUST
__label__1	This must be what Paul Ryan was talking about when he was referring to takers as opposed to makers.
__label__-1	she was probably confused
__label__-1	Did Sanders call for an end to water fluoridation and I missed it or something?
__label__1	It's because they're fair and balanced.
__label__-1	no way
__label__1	How about make those schools prisons and pocket the $400,000,000.
__label__-1	Yes because most of them are too stupid to know if their gun is loaded and end up shooting a friend or family member.
__label__1	YAY for voting against Obama instead of FOR the people.
__label__1	hey don't forget about the blacks voting against their interest
__label__1	Oh another PPP poll, should be worth looking at.
__label__1	Capitalism works!
__label__-1	I'm going to stop listening to my newspaper.
__label__1	Seriously Randy, do I have to drag Ted Cruz over to lecture you about the constitution?
__label__-1	He also couldn't take away everyone's guns and throw them in FEMA camps, but it didn't stop people from accusing him of plotting that.
__label__1	Forget the women and children save the congressmen first.
__label__1	And wiretaps, don't forget the wire taps.
__label__-1	Killing another half million Brown people should do the trick.
__label__-1	Fine, than anyone who receives public money needs to be drug tested- including law makers, bail out recipients, and so on.
__label__-1	Sounds about typical
__label__1	Women and men are equals and should be treated thusly... unless you start saying mean things, then they cry.
__label__-1	Being a Senator does not give one any special grace to vote against the position of their constituents to remain in good favor with the gun lobby.
__label__-1	trump is by far the most LGBTwtfbbq friendly member of the GOP of all time.
__label__1	Thanks Obama
__label__-1	But... but DERRHH STILINN' ARRR VVVAAAHHHTSSS

__label__1	Impeach Obama for the NSA spying scandal and replace him with a Republican that also supports the NSA spying on us!
__label__-1	i believe Russia wants the people of this country to take away the powers that be, this would be an easy way lol
__label__1	So, it was a slow day?
__label__-1	And for all that they still would probably hate him.
__label__1	Biden is just upset he is not as smart as Trump, just like the rest of us.
__label__1	Well when you lose Ted Nugent, you lose the nation.
__label__-1	Can anyone explain to me why a link to a livestream of a speech by the President of the United States is getting downvoted in the politics subreddit?
__label__1	God told him that he would, so everyone just agree that it is preordained.
__label__-1	I expect all those conservatives who are outraged about executive orders to get really pissed now, LOL.
__label__-1	Nothing suprising considering new healthcare did not go through
__label__-1	If Obama was really concerned about expanding the economy he wouldn't be trying to pass TPP
__label__-1	I suspect Trump to nominate the Marboro Man to take the position.
__label__-1	These must be the animals Trump is referring to.
__label__1	The Obama appointed John Kirby is keeping the GOP witch hunt alive I see.
__label__-1	first time ive ever agreed with trump lmao

__label__-1	I know, for the work you do.
__label__-1	Could the family sue?

__label__1	It's hard for me to believe that, after getting what he wanted, the con man isn't following through with his promises.
__label__1	He never said that.
__label__-1	Welcome to the club
__label__-1	I'm more shocked this is written by NPR
__label__-1	"Is ""Fuck off and Die"" an intention he is pondering?"
__label__-1	I bet he's still all for Russian hooker leaks.
__label__1	Why don't these tribes get a lawyer and Souix?
__label__1	What are you saying, that Clinton is falling apart?
__label__1	All those Republicans and Democrats sitting on the Fed board must be responsible or something.
__label__1	Must have been Hillary's *liberrrruhl mind beams* that made him say that.
__label__-1	Pandora's box come to real life.
__label__1	no, they have ACA not Obamacare
__label__1	We all know how wrong the polls can be!
__label__-1	Can you think of someone else who's been lying a lot who should perhaps be arrested?
__label__-1	Yes
__label__-1	"*""Trump supporter""* is the new *""Florida man""*."
__label__1	How could anyone accuse Rick Scott of playing GOP politics as usual?
__label__-1	Dear God, how can people take this guy seriously let alone vote for him?
__label__1	"He just ""became"" President..again..for the 3rd time now"
__label__-1	No one knew how many states are in the US - Trump, probably
__label__1	I'm sure that impeachment process will go real far.
__label__1	Everyone is locked away inside, banging on their keyboards as hard as they can!
__label__-1	At the end of the day, Paul Ryan is an oligarchic boot-licker who will say what he's told to say by his masters.
__label__1	But we are a Christian nation and they are Gods chosen people it is our responsibility to blindly support them in their religious terrorism

__label__1	See, it's not racist at all!
__label__1	Both parties are the same!
__label__1	TIL the left gives a damn about antisemitism/hatred of the religious in general.
__label__1	Yeah but he likes Jesus and unborn babies so fuck that guy, right?
__label__1	They already had to lay off Donald Trump.
__label__-1	TL;DR - Russia is trying to overtake our government via Trump and 4chan
__label__-1	Yes, I'm sure Hilliary will keep her word on this.
__label__-1	Yeah, he's trolling.
__label__1	Oh that clears it up, let's talk about Benghazi
__label__-1	With Donald Trump being largely quiet for the last couple of days, we were beginning to fear that people would forget that republicans hate women.
__label__-1	America is reaping the fruits of Republican Party in complete control... that's what it is doing.
__label__-1	Suspicious porn name is suspicious.
__label__-1	If you are an attractive woman there will ALWAYS be a position open for you at the weed store at the front desk.

__label__-1	I thought George Clooney was supposedly a good guy, why's he supporting Hillary?

__label__-1	Idiotic idea from a socialist pandering to idiots.
__label__-1	Clinton/Lynch for Prison 2016.
__label__1	OMG!, what about Kentucky ?
__label__1	People who point out GOP racism are racist too!
__label__-1	Imagine telling someone in 1992 that President George and Barbara Bush would be voting for Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump one day.
__label__-1	Without the freedoms given to us by our constitution, what are we as a country?
__label__1	I'm sure the Democrats are lined up to voluntarily hand over their incomes to these families in need.
__label__1	In other news, a bird shit on my car this morning....THANKS OBAMA!
__label__-1	Obamatrade supported by most republicans and far too many democrats.
__label__-1	"Hillary in November - ""at least I'm helping down ticket dems with my donations"" Hillary in April - ""Down ticket who?"""
__label__-1	Snooping sounds like snoopy so its easier to slip it past the public.
__label__1	Obviously the jobless should just join the Army, if they're unqualified to become ~~mercenaries~~ contractors.
__label__-1	Deplorable... Unamerican.. Guy is basically saying he's going to murder a Democratically elected President - even before she has a chance to govern.
__label__1	LOL yeah I'm sure they'll be successful!
__label__1	"But don't you know that calling other side ""the enemy you are most proud off"" is the best way to get something done in bipartisan way?"
__label__1	And you know how it is, once they pronounce something in Iowa that shit's set in stone.
__label__-1	A White House with zero credibility, a tyrant (trump) who is a serial sex offended and poll ratings crashing through the basement -- I would be safe to take this with grain of salt (a whole fleet of salt trucks)
__label__1	Shucks, why isn't he calling for impeachment of the President?
__label__1	Trump will say he obviously meant the attack in Atlanta.
__label__1	Great news for public education!

__label__1	"Expected Fox News headline : ""Attack on Heterosexuality""."
__label__1	There is no climate change, so stop saying that!
__label__1	"Why won't the GOP say ""Radical Christian Terrorism?"""
__label__1	Just as well, science is the devil's work
__label__1	can't imagine why there are downvotes on this
__label__-1	Students suggest that Chris Christie shut the f*** up.
__label__-1	Being crybullies have pushed around alot of politicians, but this one was elected because of that mentality... Time to suck it up and move forward.

__label__1	What a crooked evil whore.
__label__-1	Well, you can't say the GOP isn't consistent.
__label__1	I thought that Clinton had him killed.
__label__-1	Obama would never prosecute the people who pay him.
__label__1	Why won't somebody call Sean Hannity!
__label__1	Ooo I hope he's doing it to run for President!
__label__1	Obviously this means that Snopes is in the pocket of the Trump campaign.

__label__-1	Private sector race baiting with Sharpton no doubt.
__label__-1	We don't need 23 types of comments when children are going hungry in this country!

__label__1	You earned it, Mr President-elect.
__label__-1	because black lives matter is a group of fucking idiots that use any excuse to push their own agenda.
__label__-1	No shit, reward for colluding to get Hillary the primary.
__label__-1	I'm sure that was totally organic
__label__-1	This probably makes the most sense
__label__-1	Hillary would overthrow any government as long as there was a business interest.

__label__-1	They wouldn't matter as much if Congress could manage to do their jobs and legislate these issues before the courts do it for them.
__label__1	because American needs more traffic jams
__label__1	Ahh, the Wall Street Journal, that bastion of left-wing media, pushing Soros propaganda again.
__label__-1	Lol Breitbart
__label__-1	Give me over $1 TRILLION a year to spend, and I too can make the economy look good!
__label__1	It's not racist, white people are just better
__label__1	This looks credible
__label__1	Sounds like a brilliant campaign strategy to me.
__label__-1	Nunes is a traitor, he needs to be removed
__label__1	Hmmmm... I guess hiring the CEO to be your campaign CEO may be more cost effective than giving money... Trump is a brilliant business man!
__label__-1	2020, perfect vision!
__label__1	Can i get a Gatorade, I'm parched from all this winning.
__label__-1	There are that many left?
__label__-1	The pot has been stirred
__label__-1	...from himself.
__label__-1	America will find out soon enough that Hillary simply can't do the job any more than Ronald Reagan and Dubya couldn't do the job, but that their henchmen are running things, henchmen who have absolutely no obligation whatsoever to the oath of office and the American people.
__label__1	Trump supporters are just sooo smart!
__label__-1	I put everyone to work so fast, they couldn't take off to be at my inauguration.
__label__-1	it's God's will
__label__-1	Never heard of the Log Cabin Republicans?
__label__1	That's because all those people who voted for him have jobs.
__label__-1	And I bet Canada can't wait for him to renounce his Canadian citizenship!
__label__1	Just think of all the jobs he will create with that tax break.
__label__1	I'm shocked!
__label__1	Yeah, that's it!
__label__-1	Let me explain to all you poorly educated deplorables... When Trump holds up Alex Jones and Milo and David Duke on any capacity other than as assholes, he is being a piece of garbage...
__label__1	Ah, yes, we all remember the success of the 2nd Indochina War.
__label__1	Yeah, Aretha Franklin singing at inauguration, how classless.
__label__-1	Has everything, including higher education, now monetized and turned into a business?
__label__-1	Truest comment!
__label__1	I didn't realize that Trump will be dropping out so soon.
__label__1	Yep, that will all certainly offer so much help to the poor or lower middle class.
__label__1	**Breaking News**: Fork and Spoon manufacturers expected to be held responsible for people getting fat!
__label__1	Maybe god should come down and chose for us.
__label__1	It is a great news for Republicans: instead of worrying about the cost of pension, support and health coverage, the soliders sort the problem by themselves!
__label__-1	Isn't it a really good thing that the FBI came out and said this?
__label__-1	Reid Ribble (R-WI): Cunt.
__label__1	Well now, that makes it all better
__label__-1	If I type Allahu Akbar will they write an article about me?
__label__1	I'm sure this will turn out to be real
__label__1	You make a very intelligent comment.
__label__1	How dare you say that here!
__label__-1	I like to see the faces of the minority that will vote for Hillary, when Trump finally is elected President of the US of A and you guys have finally reached the point of no return.
__label__-1	Technically, way more than 1/2 of voters knew he would get an F when they voted against him in the election.
__label__-1	Party over people
__label__-1	The Trump effect.
__label__-1	Did they poll all of the small to medium sized business owners that will let the extra employees go because they'll be costing them money per hour, instead of making them money per hour?
__label__-1	I'm gonna need some proof
__label__1	This is a revolution.
__label__-1	So the South Park episode had it pretty much exactly right.
__label__-1	I am sure the Bernie or Busters with student debts that were saying how Trump is no different than Clinton must be happy now.
__label__-1	yes.
__label__-1	Empty rhetoric, unfortunately.
__label__1	Stop taxing the job creators
__label__1	Giuliani could do to diplomacy what Scarborough has done to journalism!
__label__1	Better bomb Mexico just to be safe.
__label__-1	The evangelicals/fundamentalists are evidently having a contest to see who can say the most over-the-top pronouncement about Kristianity without ever having to cite the Bible or anything else.
__label__1	I know, let's throw up the B signal and see if we can call GWB away from his painting in this hour of greatest need
__label__-1	So the difference between voting Dem or Republican comes down to whether you want to spend 80 or 85 cents being a fascist nation.
__label__-1	Because our lives are none of his damned business.
__label__-1	So then the perpetrators are going to be suspended with pay once they're found?
__label__1	That guy is a real maverick.
__label__1	What a diverse list of blue collar people that have always been about the worker and against our trade deals.
__label__-1	To replace another Catholic VP.
__label__-1	Alternate Headline: Rich guy finds out that having to work for a living is hard.
__label__-1	Ah yes but that non-report about irrelevant emails was the one that had to get publicized right before the election to avoid looking partisan...
__label__-1	How about a law that makes cemeteries only accessible if you have reason to be there.
__label__1	How could she accuse of child rape so close to the election?
__label__-1	It doesn't just seem pedantic.. It literally IS pedantic.
__label__1	Well maybe he can go back to his old job but for the life of me I can't think of what it was, I don't think he ever mentioned it.
__label__1	Good to know that I live in the best state in the country.
__label__-1	lol scam
__label__1	Hopefully it is easier to convince him when it is a really important matter.
__label__-1	I, for one, welcome our plutocratic overlords.
__label__-1	Good thats democracy
__label__1	Wow what a surprise
__label__-1	He had a heart ?
__label__1	How will we ever fix the problem if we don't stop talking about it?
__label__1	Ah yes....the evil jews are claiming there are bomb threats and knocking over tombstones in a horrific conspiracy....just like they built the concentration camps and gassed millions of themselves to get Israel established.
__label__-1	MOOCHERS
__label__1	Political affiliation of peace.
__label__-1	Is there an easy to read breakdown out there of what is specifically offsetting the cost of this?
__label__1	no, now Obama is bad too (he sided with Hillary, so he is evil), so ditching Obamacare is something you cheer for
__label__-1	Bernie Sanders campaign has been relegated to the trashbin of history, it's hardly a surprise the Trumps would go dumpster diving for some stale attacks.
__label__1	Good thinking on the all-caps, it makes it so much more believable
__label__1	Huh, I didn't know McCain posted on 4chan
__label__1	That makes her smart.
__label__-1	CKE wants to replace its cooks with robots
__label__-1	Only makes sense that the God Emperor of 4chan would be into lolis.
__label__-1	I'm here to say they won't be.
__label__1	And if Trump had gotten more votes and lost I'm sure everyone here would be saying Trump really won.
__label__1	We provide these tax cuts to our benevolent overlords so that perhaps they shine kindly down on us, showering us with entry level positions and reduced premiums.
__label__-1	I imagine the first draft said something about Trump having an extraordinarily large penis and normal sized hands.
__label__-1	If anyone thinks China is in a position to wage war with the US (especially at sea) they're grossly misinformed on China's capabilities.
__label__-1	Lmao no it isn't but okay
__label__1	Trump has the best people, the best supporters, simply the best.
__label__-1	I take most polls with a grain of salt nowadays.
__label__1	Maybe it should be in front of a burning car...
__label__1	Totally no difference between the parties!
__label__1	Yup, you caught me
__label__-1	Either retarded old religious traditions or fucked personal prejudices, or more likely both.
__label__1	She didn't know!
__label__-1	It's always projection in Gopadelphia
__label__1	Shocking
__label__1	Because there was totally a rampage of Atheist discrimination in Madison, thank goodness we've gotten that taken care of, now we can go back to picketing Chick-Fil-A and wedding cake designers and staying in bed with Iran and Saudi Arabia because we're liberals and we have our priorities straight!
__label__-1	They are looking at Canada's healthcare system one possible blue print.
__label__-1	Username checks out
__label__1	"Hey, it's just ""proof of your manhood,"" how could something like that have a dangerous impact on someone's psyche?"
__label__-1	deport her!
__label__1	We just want those librul teers!
__label__1	But but but, how else will PO's be able to make quotas?
__label__1	Hillary will offer Sanders the Cuban ambassadorship and all you fuckers will fall in line.
__label__1	Also, Deny the Holocaust while you're at it.
__label__1	C'mon, they wouldn't do that.
__label__1	Zyklon B is an alternative gas, NOT a chemical.
__label__1	drone strikes aren't a recruiting tool
__label__1	Yes and since schools have to be integrated, let's get rid of those.
__label__-1	If only
__label__1	All that Fox News watching and tweeting takes a lot of energy, he needs a Florida vacation 2 of 3 weekends to recharge.
__label__-1	"Ah, the old ""make a bunch of claims that you should support with links, and make sure the only links are to random junk food ads"" strategy."
__label__-1	Liberal Hypocrites Have No Problem Tearing Down Ambitious, Assertive Conservative Women **When Everything That Comes Out Of Their Mouth Is A Lie** FTFY, now it's truthful.
__label__1	Hey should have thought of that before choosing to be sick and poor.
__label__1	Trump surrounds himself with the best people!
__label__-1	Whisky shots - to drown the sorrow of wasting $200 million from hard working low income families.
__label__1	What an amazing COINCIDENCE.
__label__-1	republicans hate gays, whats surprising about this?
__label__-1	In other news, no fucking shit.
__label__1	History shows that there is nothing dangerous about security forces falling in line behind an authoritarian leader.
__label__1	Ladies and gentleman, I present to you our soon to be next Secretary Of State
__label__-1	So Killmead is saying the GOP has bought off more scientists than we thought?
__label__1	But many of them have brown skin, so who cares?
__label__1	Since this person said that it was about the video, then he obviously can't be one of the people behind the attack.
__label__-1	Emotional instability is what I look for in a candidate.
__label__-1	What's it say about our system when a billionaire opens to the possibility of running for public office to a media outlet that locked behind a paywall.
__label__1	It's like Clinton is a special interest to the rest of the dnc establishment....but no one should expect that the dnc establiment would be swayed by Hilary's funding channels.
__label__-1	And by doing so, they've contributed to the inflation of college tuition.
__label__-1	That's funny, because I don't know how the CEO and Executives live with themselves.
__label__-1	So what?
__label__-1	And here come the conspiratards...
__label__-1	exactly.
__label__-1	Man, every looney toon just comes out of wood works during a presidential run dont they?
__label__1	This must be why she's been charged with and convicted of so many crimes.
__label__-1	"""but I sure as hell can cash his checks!"""
__label__1	No they will miss Cruz to much.
__label__1	Kind of like investing in Casinos with nothing but borrowed money.
__label__1	but...but jobs are seasonal in July!
__label__-1	You can't explain this.
__label__-1	holy shit that is beyond stupid
__label__-1	Yes, the party of Lincoln, where today many proudly wave the confederate flag.
__label__1	Lucky for us we're getting both.
__label__1	Comey is obviously Russian.
__label__-1	Clearly he is mentally ill.
__label__-1	Shadilay!
__label__-1	Because their skin is thinner.
__label__-1	They dum.
__label__1	Well that takes care of that!
__label__-1	Do you really think the country is faring well right now?
__label__-1	Hahahaha
__label__1	but gravity is just a theory not a fact
__label__1	I was willing to give President Trump a chance, but this is where I draw the line!
__label__1	I guess, now I know why Chris Christie dropped out!
__label__1	Yay for online volunteer polling!
__label__1	Just another coincidence I'm sure
__label__-1	I'll bring the marshmallows!
__label__-1	this should be the one cabinet post where trump actually knows a qualified person and yet... here we are
__label__1	This was sometime after Obama forged his US birth certificate and college grades.
__label__-1	This is why we need the death penalty
__label__1	She didn't have any encryption on that server, so she's following what she preaches.
__label__1	Yeah because Hillary never lied under oath
__label__1	Well this will certainly help his campaign.
__label__-1	This isn't good, this will just win him more votes among the braindead morons he's appealing to
__label__1	Bring on that police state!
__label__1	What's the point of being a fascist if you don't have a secret police force?
__label__1	It's her time, forget the crime!
__label__-1	Is he going to make the background check system freely available to the public that he's trying to fuck, since he wants more background checks?
__label__-1	just another waste of paper.
__label__-1	Whitest arrest ever
__label__1	A president not doing what they said while running.. SHOCKING
__label__1	"A new ""fact"" is now firmly established in Alaska."
__label__-1	Because of death threats
__label__-1	But that's the job of a courtier, dontchya know.
__label__-1	We hear this like biweekly, what's new?
__label__1	Coming from such a credible source I cannot help but believe this is true!
__label__1	Well it is his *Winter White House*
__label__-1	If Congress passed laws that required drug prices in the US to be similar to Canada, then Pharma would find a way to jack up Canadian prices.
__label__-1	Christie is taking over the Republican void created when Lindsay flip flopped on Trump.
__label__-1	Well this will certainly rustle some jimmies.
__label__1	It's ok when a Republican does it.
__label__-1	ah this had nothing to do with obama #fucktrump
__label__-1	To be fair, you do as she says not as she does.
__label__-1	"When can we just start calling him the ""Conman in Chief"""
__label__1	So ... really important issues then.
__label__1	It's a sweeping mandate!
__label__-1	"Earning his nickname ""Deadbeat Donny""."
__label__1	Today I learned that lawyer, author, senator, and Secretary of State are not real jobs.
__label__1	"The ""States' Rights"" candidate."
__label__-1	Your move, California.
__label__1	Chinese Hoax.
__label__-1	nothing will be done by anyone.
__label__-1	I have neither the time nor the technical skill to do this, but I've always hoped that someone could generate a running total of apologies, from Republicans compared to Democrats.
__label__-1	"So, can we stop asking ""What if there was an election and nobody voted?"""
__label__1	Yea, because PC culture, being tolerant, is the reason.
__label__-1	Hahaha
__label__-1	still, maybe not in a few months or years
__label__-1	Prove it or shut the fuck up Donny.
__label__1	Such a reputable source
__label__-1	Then when democrat's have congress you'll bitch all day long about how they're dictators when they play by the same rules right?
__label__-1	Trump is uncoachable.
__label__-1	\**Crosses fingers**
__label__-1	Hillary used Foundation for taking bribes.
__label__-1	Lol when has it ever been a priority for the US?
__label__-1	It's well documented that a money could outperform most stock market investors so this is not news.
__label__-1	College is not for everyone.
__label__1	Totally a terrorist attack for people to attack a force that is invading and bombing their homeland.
__label__1	Yes, please smoke underage so that the opposition can use you as a catalyst for their cause.
__label__1	A billionaire who has never paid taxes is *so* the hero of the working class.
__label__-1	There is a double-standard that says it is okay to be forceful like that to man, but not to a woman.
__label__1	So we need to deport their US-born children even more!
__label__1	Simple: Because her emailzzzzzzzz!
__label__-1	Isn't it simpler to just figure out which of them didn't meet with Russians ?
__label__-1	Schiff must save us all.
__label__-1	considering she wants to play chicken with russia over a no fly zone in Syria.. Trump is correct.. this time.
__label__-1	Walker should be the GOP's man in 2016.
__label__-1	If Donald truly thinks the election is rigged he should withdraw.
__label__-1	This headline, daily.
__label__1	Hillary is just trying to be a lead by example in the no encryption/digital security age!
__label__-1	Better than a few years back when the police actually arrested journalists.
__label__-1	hows about retroactive abortions for the base.
__label__1	A real SEAL body would have rejected the bullet.
__label__-1	for fuck's sake
__label__1	Now that's what I call a mandate!
__label__-1	Trump knows that his tax returns are a key part to what will eventually be his downfall.
__label__-1	No surprise there.
__label__-1	Sears' stock just went up
__label__-1	OP is prejudiced.
__label__1	I think we can all agree this is fake news.
__label__1	No no she later added per capita at the end of her statement a few days later so its ok now.
__label__-1	Libs have finally fried their remaining brain cells.
__label__-1	To be fair to Trump and Sean Sphincter, it's totes Obama's fault that the guy he fired in 2014 was Trump's National Security Advisor and Trump didn't even make him go through the security clearance process.
__label__1	You'd be surprised what the Volkssturm can do when you're willing to commit to Total War.
__label__-1	I definitely feel like Hillary has done everything she can to make herself look untrustable, incapable and uncharming.
__label__1	So, basically nothing?
__label__1	How dare they try to redefine what marriage means!
__label__1	Yes, but a lot of those voters were old, black, or Latino, so not as important.
__label__-1	Sounds pretty awesome.
__label__1	But, but, the fraudsters are so good they never get caught!
__label__1	This is clearly Trumps fault.
__label__1	10 Electors, 9 of which are Democrats... Yeah, totally the entire EC
__label__1	That's like 30 per state, I don't know how our infrastructure and economy will sustain it.
__label__1	Why do you hate America?
__label__-1	Dow Jones now at all-time high.
__label__1	Consumers just need to shut up, buy, wear, eat what the giant monopolists sell, no matter if it kills them or steals their assets.
__label__1	That's not concerning at all
__label__-1	I wonder who
__label__-1	Fucking good...finally!
__label__-1	Because you know, conservatives are known for their particularly peaceful ways.
__label__1	Diplomatic prowess right there
__label__-1	And this isn't even close to a major problem compared to the fact a reality tv huckster is now going to rule the world and decide if there's nuclear war.
__label__-1	He said that the material he received about Trump was already available publicly.
__label__1	And yet Republican Presidents continued to make thousands of them!
__label__1	Because killing unarmed civilians with a pistol is too much of a hassle.
__label__-1	We need a Northern wall, fuck it lets just put a dome over america
__label__-1	Cool, now can we stop thinking that it's only 1 political party that's the problem?
__label__-1	If Trump's pattern holds true, he'll laugh off the high cost estimate by rallying his supporters around the idea of making the newly uninsured pay for it.
__label__-1	Oh, that's definitely not going to happen so this isn't really news.
__label__-1	As a member of ISIS I support this policy.
__label__1	"This has nothing to do with Bannon's idea that the ""Judeo-Christian West"" needs to fight a global cultural war and that there are too many Asian techies in Silicon Valley."
__label__1	Because the other side played fair the entire election
__label__1	But it's her turn!
__label__-1	This is not news
__label__1	It was Obama and Susan Rice!
__label__-1	Not to mention because of the electoral college stupidity, less than half a dozen states could even remotely possibly affect results by purely hypothetical voter fraud.
__label__-1	and everyone knows the best way to encourage people to join your side is to lecture them about what you perceive as their faults
__label__-1	Can Clinton still use the sexism card when a fellow woman calls her out on her shit?
__label__-1	Oh my fucking god, Tapper's tone at the beginning of this is amazing.
__label__-1	How else is he going make sure his audience understand?
__label__1	I'm sure this will look good in 2020 or 2024.
__label__1	The libural thought police is at it again!
__label__1	He's sorry though guys.
__label__1	Can we keep civil forfeiture in place but only for the real drug dealers.
__label__1	Calling Bernie supporters Bernie Bro's and Obama supporters Obama boys is the highest form of praise in Elizabethan English.
__label__1	If only we had compulsory voting Bernie would be President.
__label__-1	So, besides the ever-attractive anti-Monsanto hate-boner circle-jerk, what exactly is new or relevant about this article?
__label__1	It doesn't have any effect on him though because he's already rich.
__label__1	that 4D chess huh MAGAs
__label__-1	Dude, that's like Kelly Osbourne bad.
__label__-1	Only his uninformed followers would.
__label__-1	This headline could have read: No longer relevant author points out news stories that have been in circulation for weeks.
__label__1	Trump is famous for his humble nature, I'm sure he just donated the money anonymously.
__label__-1	It takes real balls to be a man of conviction in politics
__label__-1	Fire him and ride him off University grounds on a rail.
__label__1	Yeah but they only did it to brown non Americans so it's ok
__label__-1	There's a big difference between a guy like Stern, who's a bit sleazy and vulgar, and a predator like Donald Trump.
__label__-1	"There are some adblock programs that also get around those, like ""Ublock Origin"""
__label__-1	There is no comparison, Benghazi was a made up story; Russian interference with USA election and possible Trump collusion is a big deal
__label__1	FAKE NEWS!
__label__1	Well, why did she wait so long?
__label__1	You mean **President** Bannon
__label__-1	Is it me, or is conflict of interest resonating throughout this entire process?
__label__1	They have to, because they know in their hearts they should have been aborted.
__label__1	These single parents should have kept her knees together if she didn't want to pay higher taxes.
__label__-1	How're his modeling skills?
__label__-1	Shame on all of them
__label__-1	Thanks for the moment of comedy, OP!
__label__1	"""Huffington Post"" Really credible news source you have there!"
__label__-1	So far not much.
__label__-1	I am reminded of the South Park episode: Human CentiPad.
__label__1	No because me saving my small amount of tax dollars is more important than someones illness/preventable death.
__label__-1	David Muir's look of incredulity in the article photo, staring in astonishment as Trump blathers on, is priceless.
__label__1	They're just working that much harder than everyone else, I mean I bet they put in some crazy overtime.
__label__-1	Yet these same people gladly elect and reelect corrupt politicians.
__label__-1	Battery glitch.
__label__-1	but but he is a master negotiator?
__label__1	Fake news!
__label__-1	Soros belongs in Prison
__label__-1	Not really new if it's from 2013.
__label__1	Fox was right, I am shocked
__label__-1	He also wants to see all of her Atari high-scores.
__label__-1	Newsflash: rural Georgia person is hateful, ignorant racist.
__label__1	ya, lets listen to what trump fans say, cause they're SO smart
__label__-1	San Francisco is a great city and a tolerant place to live, as long as you're a tech millionaire.
__label__-1	Good
__label__-1	Aww, not enough safe spaces for you?
__label__1	Classic chess master move, you've played right into Tumps hands shillary
__label__1	I guess there's no chance that the Democrats will recognize the Armenian Genocide after this
__label__1	Its not, but she's rich and powerful, guess we all better call it a day and drink thier cool-aid.
__label__-1	So?
__label__1	But this is different
__label__-1	Please release anything just distract from this Russia thing!
__label__-1	Lies just like her dad.
__label__1	Exactly the sort of thing the President should be micromanaging.
__label__-1	If the government stops funding Planned parenthood, does it go away?
__label__-1	That's not really a plausible defense, old boy
__label__-1	He would burst into flames upon entering anyway.
__label__1	This is appropriate, because no Russian **ever** got asylum in the USA.
__label__1	Yes because Antifa = Liberal Democrats.
__label__1	That's why we must rid ourselves of the scourge of Obamacare.
__label__1	Trump hires only the best people
__label__-1	The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a cigarette is a good guy with a cigarette.
__label__-1	Radical Christian terrorism.
__label__-1	Tump 2020.
__label__-1	Ban guns!
__label__1	It's because the RNC wasn't hiding anything interesting.
__label__1	Sooo, like 5 people?
__label__-1	And Trump houses the Royal family in his building there.
__label__1	They should let him debate, and then just censor him out for any of the states where he's below 15%
__label__1	It's okay to stereotype and insult the south because they're just dumb hicks!
__label__1	I love when a man tells women how women feel.
__label__-1	This just in: Poll justifies whatever you believe personally.
__label__-1	Why should development be paid for?
__label__-1	SO BRAVE
__label__1	Bear in mind guys, he only spent 5 months on Trump's team, so his role in the campaign was quite limited.
__label__1	You know that's funny because I'm a card carrying Republican, as evidenced by my beliefs in increasing minority access to voting, the realization that trickle down economics will never, ever work, and of course, my dedication to supporting life once it emerges from the womb.
__label__1	Well that's certainly a realistic endeavor.
__label__1	We can just use the 12B surplus Trump has already created
__label__1	Romney talked about repealing Dodd-Frank... The laws that got put in place to regulate the mortgage industry and help stop the sub-prime lending issues... Wonderful
__label__1	shouldn't be a problem - they've got such a deep bench
__label__1	# Palin for Vice President!
__label__1	This is for the children after all
__label__1	Well it rhymes, it must be true!
__label__1	Count me shocked!
__label__-1	Apparently, Republicans aren't done embarrassing themselves yet.
__label__1	Fair and Balanced
__label__1	Native Americans might be all for deporting the great, great, great, great, etc, grandchildren of illegal aliens.
__label__1	"Better stop with all that ""facts"" ""evidence"" and ""logic"" talk boy!"
__label__-1	Is there some way we can check people's blood for junk food and/or steak as well?
__label__1	The Republican Party has the best people
__label__-1	Because he's weak.
__label__-1	It's much too soon to be looking at these numbers.
__label__-1	Jesus christ, Ajit Pai is a hack.
__label__-1	Chipotle for everyone!
__label__1	Yes...laws, regulations, ethical standards are for peasants.
__label__1	They should love teh gays, they will never need an abortion.
__label__1	Who could have possibly predicted Sanders supporters wouldn't support Clinton?
__label__-1	"""Brought down Osama Bin Laden"" pics or it didn't happen."
__label__1	Im not convinced until we find a reddit account post that confirns this.
__label__1	well its not breitbart so it must be fake news
__label__1	And those illegals!
__label__-1	Where's the Megathread?
__label__1	Well it is Obama's fault for being black.
__label__1	...gasp, and any moment now, economic Armageddon!
__label__1	Quit being a bible thumping racist

__label__1	Hey Texas; if you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about!
__label__-1	Yup
__label__1	That's not a biased headline at all
__label__1	this administration is doing a great job with that ... keep up the good work and soon we'll be saying Thanks Hillary instead of Thanks Obama
__label__1	I'm shocked, shocked that a President of the United States would even suggest being a responsible, law-biding partner in the global community of nations.
__label__1	Champion of the people
__label__-1	Far from a trump supporter but Bernie should get grilled about this it was mostly Bernie bros out there
__label__-1	Scott Walker: a misinformed Kochsucker who lives inside a bubble.
__label__1	Ashley Madison?
__label__1	but the government can't create jobs!
__label__-1	In my opinion you could make the argument this is even a whole lot of racist creep here.
__label__1	But where's the proof!
__label__1	Well maybe that's a good thing, didn't hurt Reagan any
__label__-1	She looks like a meme
__label__1	Its a good thing republicans in congress made sure we have a good mental health system, so we can catch thjngs like this early.
__label__-1	"And if those protesters were prevented from protesting the Fox headline would be, ""Tyrant Obama Violating Freedom of Speech of Protesters!!!"""
__label__1	Thanks Republicans, always can count on you to do the right thing!
__label__1	I mean, what if someone smuggles a nuclear bomb into the country in a big shipment of pot?
__label__-1	too late, already a done deal
__label__-1	That's cute Harry, you're not the *Majority* leader any more.
__label__1	and I am sure the Republicans who wasted millions of dollars having a thousand investigations over Benghazi will be sure to question Comey on his partisan efforts
__label__-1	This lady is dumb and indicative of the hypocrisy of her order.
__label__1	But its OK because Trump has a beautiful family.
__label__-1	That reminds me, Hillary touched me inappropriately at her last rally.
__label__-1	I'm voting for Pedro.
__label__-1	Way to plant, Egg.
__label__-1	TLDR: bunch of circle jerk liberals are upset that we killed a known terrorist, living in the Pakistan/Afghanistan extremist area who plotted the Christmas bombings AND happened to be an American.

__label__-1	and download to a database the police dont have access to.
__label__-1	Yup, seems like the Greatest Job Creator God ever Created has been more preoccupied with firing everyone in sight.
__label__-1	The idea that a neocon and a neolib would have radically different policies is the biggest lie in America politics.
__label__1	Well, at least you're human.
__label__-1	So lets invest 10 trillion.
__label__-1	This was actually taken before the Khan comments so I suspect that this will look even worse for Trump next week.
__label__1	That means treason case must be worse than the holocaust then.
__label__-1	"Mark my words, pretty soon Politifact will need a ""Spontaneous Combustion"" level."
__label__1	Yeah, it's Democrats who have to tread lightly here
__label__1	CNN is headquartered in Atlanta, so it's no surprise that we're only now hearing about the attack, thanks to the destruction of fake news.
__label__-1	Hillary saying Sanders supported these guys over undocumented people because of one of his votes was the moment the democratic primary went from a love fest to Game of Thrones for me.
__label__-1	The stability of the ground she stands on is a bit questionable, though.
__label__-1	Next week the blackmail investigations begin
__label__-1	This is just: the GOP establishment has asked all Muslims in America to begin wearing a special symbol on their clothing so they can be easily identified in public.
__label__1	Yeah, its progressives fault the cults of Abraham followers have been slaughtering people they dont like for thousands of years.
__label__-1	Well you know he's like a smart person
__label__1	I'm sure this hit piece will be the one to take down Trump
__label__-1	2.5 Million vote lead.
__label__-1	It's in the same evidence folder that has info on Obama being Kenyan, thie Chinese global warming hoax, and vaccines causing autism.
__label__-1	You got conned.

__label__1	but when *I* do it its doxxing, and I get banned, thanks hitler mods
__label__-1	Why aren't our buddies, the Saudis, doing this for us?
__label__1	I bet all of the agriculture Republicans will be delighted at this.

__label__-1	Why ?
__label__1	From the man who put food before campaigning
__label__1	Conversely... 30,000+ Shocking Things Hillary Clinton Didn't Want To Give Up This Election.
__label__-1	most non-americans also endorse bernie sanders lets hope he can make sure the US isn't the cause of most of the world's problems
__label__-1	That's a very dumb opinion piece.
__label__-1	A broken analog clock is right twice a day.
__label__-1	Can they happen in year 68?
__label__-1	Clinton is a terribly flawed candidate and if the rest of the Democratic party establishment has any sense they'll flip on her as quickly as she flopped on coal.
__label__1	Clearly the solution is huge tax cuts for the extremely wealthy.
__label__1	Obviously this test was created to support Hillary by highlighting all of trumps flaws without supporting any of his strengths.
__label__1	yeah, Venezuela is such a successful socialist utopia, that its favor trumps that of the United States.
__label__1	Too easily faked, as we can see with OBUMMER
__label__1	Gee... Now THERE'S a big surprise.
__label__1	*I'm sure these two tweets (which are both deleted) totally wasn't a marketing attempt from the start*
__label__1	How can it be the truth if it's fake news
__label__1	What are the odds that two ultra rich women involved in fashion business would know each other?
__label__-1	These guidelines will last forever, or until the next Republican administration.
__label__-1	Republicare at its best
__label__1	I really hope that committee Trump forms to investigate pay to play, goes after this
__label__1	Thankfully our government has a solid, well-defined separation of church and state.
__label__1	Wrong!
__label__-1	With Science!
__label__-1	Good, it means Wall Street is not putting their money on Trump.
__label__1	To be fair, they couldn't possibly have anticipated that a tornado would hit Oklahoma and cause widespread damage.
__label__-1	But remeber guys hes different, hes not the establishment, he wont go easy on wall st... oh shit wait a minute
__label__1	But didn't the kids sign a social contract to take on the debt ?
__label__1	You're wrong, Hillary Clinton will instill fear into the hearts of Donald Trump and Republicans alike
__label__1	well, he drains the swamp
__label__1	It's a good thing we didn't elect Hillary Clinton with all of her ties to Wall Street.
__label__1	Man, how dare Sanders point out the criminal's constant lying......what shameful behavior
__label__1	I hope UN deploys international poll observers to ensure free and fair elections
__label__-1	Maybe if so many Americans got out and voted as opposed to being bamboozled into thinking voting 'doesn't matter' - we'd have a government that actually served our interests.
__label__1	"""The side that isn't listening to *fake news*!"""
__label__1	Wow, Neil Young sure showed him!
__label__1	"I'm SO glad the the Iraq war only took slightly more than a month before it was all over and our fearless leader could declare ""Mission Accomplished!"""
__label__1	Where is Sam Fischer?
__label__-1	Wow the incompetence is staggering it seems like as long as the GOP chants no new taxes they can get away with anything.
__label__-1	He can shove his wall up his arse.
__label__-1	That's pretty much what Bernie has said, one pick at a time.
__label__1	Yeah, clearly this is corroborated by hard evidence which will soon be released to the public as opposed to a shameless attempt to distract from his alleged ties to Russia.
__label__1	Didn't 36% of voters elect Trump in the first place?
__label__-1	Sanders can win every primary from here on out and still be behind unless he wins by huge margins.
__label__-1	"How about instead of giving tax breaks to ""job creators"" so they can create jobs, we give tax breaks to ""job creators"" AFTER they create jobs?"
__label__-1	If this story breaks the same way the Flynn story did, we can expect the NYT or WP to publish an article saying the FBI has a tape of Sessions talking with Kislyak about relieving sanctions on Russia.
__label__-1	Probably like 30 more minutes of easily-failable questioning if you're suspicious about it.
__label__-1	"How would they spread propaganda if they didn't employ ""journalists""?"
__label__-1	Schiff: Circumstantial evidence of collusion, direct evidence of deception.
__label__-1	Good god

__label__-1	With cha boys.
__label__-1	Slate you'd be better off running a movie theater than a blog with you much you project.

__label__1	Some kinda dog food?
__label__-1	Three year pay freeze.
__label__-1	...At which point the bill will be dead on arrival.
__label__-1	wait for them, they are coming.

__label__-1	"The toughest part of that sentence, is ""hurt their bottom line"" The economy is complicated... Vote Bernie"
__label__1	But, it's all cool, because Trump hates feminists and brown people.
__label__-1	Enabling Act , part 1
__label__1	yes i'm sure they wholeheartedly supported the candidate who was most critical of them.
__label__1	shocked I tell you, shocked.
__label__1	To the front page!
__label__-1	standard police procedure
__label__1	And the world will believe them if they say that.
__label__1	yassss QUEEEN SLAYYYY
__label__-1	During the primaries I suspected that Sanders was pretty naive but since the DNC convention he's pretty much confirmed it
__label__-1	God have mercy on our souls
__label__1	Yes, infowars is the place to find solutions to all our problems.
__label__-1	Watch the Exxon stock explode in the next months.
__label__1	He better hurry up with that Sharia law
__label__1	Political censorship of art has such a great tradition in democratic nations, so why not?
__label__-1	Aren't they technically the USSR?
__label__-1	So maybe that's why he only wants to be paid a dollar as president, garnished wages.
__label__1	People were booing Trump so now he takes revenge on Boeing
__label__1	This was all bullshit yesterday, but I'm sure it's completely legit today.
__label__1	Because the rest of the news about him is fake.
__label__-1	Its pretty sad that ABC had to waste time to explain that the image was misleading.
__label__1	But he held up a flag!
__label__-1	lol
__label__-1	More like Pants on Fire false, but ok?
__label__1	Dumpster should declare war on both and take their oil!
__label__1	At least it wasn't wasted, it went right to the economy thanks to all that defense spending!
__label__1	If you think the market can regulate itself, it must mean you hate poor people.
__label__-1	This just in: Utah set to force children to sit in silence during music class, bans teaching of instruments.
__label__-1	Misleading title- not literal
__label__1	Never would have expected hypocrisy from Trump.
__label__-1	That rat faced fuck Chaffetz is a fucking coward.
__label__1	Shouldn't we only care about Pence's return since he'll be the acting president anyway?
__label__-1	100% Of Trump Supporters Are Morons - Obvious Times
__label__-1	Honestly at this point this presidency seems more like a social experiment than anything else
__label__-1	Who was born to huge wealth, then got away with driving four companies into bankruptcy, stiffing most of his contractors?
__label__-1	His plan was to Donate it to the Trump Foundation, but since that seems to be having some operational issues, he decided to cut out the middle man and put his salary directly into his pocket.
__label__-1	Is tradeau some sort of Australian trading company and why do they hate a mosque in Quebec
__label__-1	Yep, Hanoi Jane Fonda used to show up and suck his cock every time he told his men not to fire.
__label__1	Wow, so surprised that didn't work.
__label__1	Ignoring the law is called 'enforcing the law.'
__label__1	But her emails!

__label__1	Seems like a credible site
__label__1	Glad to see actual politics discussed here.
__label__1	If there's one thing Herr Drumpf has in spades, it's class.
__label__1	If only they just pulled themselves up by their GODDAMN BOOTSTRAPS!
__label__-1	And this is after how many lost jobs?
__label__1	"Because the last few ""regime changes"" we did went so well!"
__label__1	"I'm glad they were so serious about ""extreme vetting"" of refugees but not administration staff."
__label__1	See...he has already eliminated Climate Change!
__label__1	Thank god we didn't elect a woman, we might have ended up with someone temperamental and petty.
__label__-1	I wonder how many conservatives care about this at all.
__label__1	But a small minority of the population constituted a landslide, and a clear mandate.
__label__-1	Must be nice to have the economic and social privilege to just get up and move anywhere you want.
__label__1	Oh, that's surprising.
__label__1	I'm sure this won't be abused in huge quantities.
__label__1	Clearly you must be a terrorist for questioning this noble bill...USA USA USA.
__label__1	I'm actually inclined to agree with him at this point.
__label__1	Just wait until after the debates.
__label__-1	inb4 buried
__label__-1	I don't think it makes one damn bit of difference how he manipulated a quote because people who want to believe that those *others* who are poor are poor because they are dirty and lazy and ignorant and leeches and thieves and fat and ugly and baby-making-making for profit machines and just plain waste of oxygen and drug addicts and users and abusers and not of any value at all and should just go on and die already.
__label__1	Let them eat steak.
__label__-1	It means you have very shady friends, and are increasingly being seen as guilty by association.
__label__-1	Does this mean someone will finally get my order right at a fast food joint?
__label__1	"that ""wild wild west money"""
__label__1	Found Clinton.

__label__-1	"""I believe"", ""I believe"", ""I believe"" No cites, no sources and it's just gospel to his brain dead acolytes, bring up something questioning Trump with sources and cites to these same acolytes and they just dismiss it."
__label__-1	Republicans are worse than worthless.
__label__1	And the only way to prevent war is to vanquish your enemies before war can start!
__label__-1	Enhanced sites with alternative interrogation techniques.
__label__-1	It's not about balancing the budget.
__label__1	Just trying to get government out of your life!
__label__-1	Bannon is on the way out, it's the only way for trump to keep in power.
__label__-1	Dang good recall brother
__label__1	Right because that's the same as this
__label__1	Obviously it's because he's a closet Muslim terrorist trying to destroy freedom and murica!
__label__1	but that makes us free!
__label__1	But Justice Kennedy, in the CU ruling, said that it didn't even give the appearance of bribery so clearly Carter is insane.
__label__1	i dunno, i think having to take off my shoes off and throw away my water at airports is a great idea
__label__-1	"You're forgetting the likelihood of ""outside donors"" just being a way for Trump to launder money."
__label__1	Don't worry, he's just play no 54 dimensional chess with lgbq rights
__label__1	Oh gee, what a nice moderate Republican he is.
__label__-1	Y'all know that they like doing the opposite of what you ask for, right?
__label__1	Surely this time will work
__label__-1	Oh great now we are going to descend into anarchy, just like the way things were before police had tasers.
__label__1	"But ""both parties are the same"", huh?"
__label__1	Yeah, sure.
__label__-1	Probably would have been stronger That was just my preference
__label__1	But it's her turn
__label__-1	"Gingrich: ""If everyone didn't know what a turd our candidate is, nobody would know what a turd he is."""

__label__-1	Sounds like you need *more* government, right conservatives?
__label__1	This is going to be great for the poor and middle class!

__label__1	Yea, but he needed to do that to get all the drugs off the street!
__label__-1	This is a 1st amendment right, good luck.
__label__-1	Ironic coming from the woman who destroys evidence under subpeona and smashes her phones.
__label__1	But tax cuts produce more revenue!
__label__1	We'll thank god that's all over with.
__label__1	... and got us a crazy person elected instead, good job Assange.
__label__-1	I smell a plan brewing.
__label__1	Great, we know video evidence helped bring charges against the cop(s) who killed Eric Garner with suffocation.
__label__-1	Nice try Hillary.

__label__1	Guys, we need more bombs to drop on brown people, we can't afford art.
__label__-1	Why wouldn't he take it and give it to charity or something?
__label__1	People's opinions evolve bruh.
__label__1	Right, because Congress oversees the FCC and appoints its commissioner
__label__-1	The school was just embarrassed he was treating class like an episode of The Young Turks or CNN
__label__-1	Republicans would rather debate a bill to list magic as an art form
__label__-1	This is an outright stolen election, if common sense and decency factor in at all.
__label__-1	This is a joke right?
__label__1	Since the shooter was radicalized on the Internet,we should probably ban that too.
__label__1	so whats the latest score in this game terrorists vs cops
__label__-1	Oh.

__label__1	Climate change isnt real.... Putin is.
__label__-1	His body isn't even cold yet, and she's already turned around to fuck his supporters in the ass
__label__-1	Yes, Trump would not be a leading candidate if this was a 1st world country.
__label__1	Did it form in the same place as Obama's birth certificate and college transcripts are hidden?
__label__1	Yes, a politician can make that call.
__label__1	We need a money bomb for Bernie right now, it aint over yet!

__label__-1	I don't care about Hillary's emails and I am also willing to give Petraeus a pass because he's actually reasonably sane unlike most of Trump's other picks.
__label__1	And wikileaks is covering it up!
__label__1	Yeah, Donald Trump will be a great President
__label__-1	The Pope is irrelevant to the US and Bernie choosing to go partake in Vatican nonsense during an election shows how scared and not dedicated he is to the task at hand.
__label__1	But... But... But... Socialism!
__label__-1	"As a great man once said, ""check out sex tape."""
__label__-1	wew
__label__-1	He should be locked up for perjury.
__label__-1	I bet he is wishing he had been slightly less of a prick to his fellow senators right about now.
__label__-1	This could realistically start an actual Jihad against the US.
__label__1	And I bet this will be the first time in 2000 years that anything like this has happened to the bible.
__label__-1	"""Wrong, that's a horse poll, Fakenews"""
__label__-1	And, of course, any women not in compliance are just godless whores who get what they deserve.
__label__-1	Maybe FBI shouldn't have tried so hard to get him elected?
__label__-1	"I hope ""Bernie or Bust"" feels *really* good about themselves."
__label__-1	A lot of politicians do the same.
__label__1	But I thought the election was rigged!
__label__-1	Can't wait to see how the Chinese react.
__label__1	Yep, Hillary's stance on guns has centrist republican written all over it.
__label__-1	The poling was done by ORC
__label__1	He is making so many sacrifices to be our President
__label__-1	A little ironic if a conservative group cancels on him when they have been non-stop rage-flinging feces every time a LIBRUL university cancels on him.
__label__1	What a shame that would be.
__label__1	the witch must burn
__label__1	Maybe it's the death panels the Republicans put into the bill.
__label__-1	"Just because ""Washington"" and Wall Street both begin with the letter ""W"" doesn't mean they are the same entity."
__label__-1	Twist: RNC and donors purchase multiple mercenary groups and take over the country for themselves.
__label__1	What they need are some Superdelegates!
__label__-1	"Then you're just as anti democratic as ""them""."
__label__1	I think Pat Roberts ought to attack them for handing out the tools of abortion.
__label__1	Well since she says so... that makes it okay right guys?
__label__1	But both sides are the same and Hillary would have been so terrible
__label__-1	Where is this in our constitution?
__label__-1	Just like we waited for the facts about the Trump rape case.
__label__1	From the side of Obamas family not born in Kenya?
__label__-1	"Would've been funny if not for ""origional."""
__label__1	Obama's parting gift to his loyal Hope and Change folks will be Obamatrade, it will usher in a new era just like NAFTA did
__label__1	Yeah that's going to happen.
__label__-1	When can we impeach the orange buffoon already?
__label__-1	Pathetic.
__label__1	Don't worry, CNN published it so it's not true.
__label__-1	"""I don't think"".... let that sink in for a moment."
__label__-1	Unpopular but ironically he is one of the most powerful in modern history, sad
__label__1	I'm sure that won't cost the taxpayers more money
__label__1	:O
__label__1	Sure, because wiping out what is left of accountability is a great idea!
__label__1	Yeah, but it's not fair because they can't gerrymander Senate elections.
__label__-1	What a coward.
__label__1	Job creators should have the freedom not to pay their employes if their they are not worth the overtime.
__label__-1	I am increasingly sure that Russia has a ton of blackmail on a lot of the GOP, including gay stuff.
__label__1	But no one is trying to take your guns!
__label__-1	He is *potentially* not guilty by reason of insanity, but that's a hard defense to make *and* he'd still be in an asylum for the rest of his life if the defense worked.
__label__1	Clearly a terrorist trying to destroy America!
__label__1	How else are they to protect their citizens from gay generated tornados and earthquakes?
__label__1	I just love reddit, it's where I learn all the secret stuff
__label__1	Petty vindictiveness is very presidential!
__label__1	Hey, she's only honoring his memory!
__label__-1	Good, the less fatties the better.
__label__1	I'm sure the free-market will provide an alternative.
__label__-1	Literally phoning it in.
__label__1	That damn Commie!
__label__1	But, guys, he's only taking a salary of $1 from the office.
__label__-1	They know first hand haha
__label__-1	/thundering applause
__label__1	I must say I am terribly shocked!
__label__-1	Trump will blame the Mayor of London.
__label__-1	So he's discriminating against buildings now?
__label__1	Obviously he's not a True Patriot Republican^TM
__label__1	We should just install gun vending machines throughout the nation.
__label__-1	Politics?
__label__1	But #notallchristians right?
__label__-1	This is going to be a very tough call for a lot of Republicans.
__label__1	Maybe it'll only affect the 6 to 10 million illegals that voted for Clinton.
__label__1	If only the democrats were in power everything would be just fine, there would have been no banking crisis, no housing market failure, no war in Iraq, no indefinite detention, no Patriot Act, etc.
__label__-1	Trump decided he wasn't content only getting 1% or 2% of the black vote, he needs to get 0%.
__label__-1	Religion, the great separator.
__label__-1	Is this different from any typical company dress code?
__label__-1	"Am I the only one who noticed van susteren said ""you know"" 11 times?"
__label__1	Because fuck the Obamas that's why.
__label__-1	Coming to a Theater Near You: The Madness of King Trump!
__label__-1	Didn't she beach her ship once?
__label__1	Gotta hone in that short game sometime
__label__-1	lying ass BITCH
__label__1	If Obama didn't hate white people then he would have the decency to be white himself!
__label__1	tax dollars well spent
__label__-1	Mission Accomplished.
__label__-1	Even that version is pretty terrible.
__label__1	Totally the same as MSNBC
__label__-1	This defines the party.
__label__-1	The first of many Republican decisions that will kill Americans.
__label__1	That ought to keep guns out of the hands of the bro- er, poor people!
__label__1	The only thing left is for him to be accused of secret encounters with rent boys.
__label__-1	Wouldn't it be nice if gas prices came down.
__label__1	He's such a great businessman though!
__label__1	What a travesty
__label__1	God damn political correctness
__label__-1	Good thing we are a republic and not a democracy
__label__1	Well it was staged by Obama to take ah gunz!
__label__-1	I honestly had forgotten the tea party existed.
__label__-1	Yeah guys, we should vote for the former Wal-Mart executive who only has $800 million dollars instead of a billion, now *that's* a working class candidate!
__label__1	Hey look, someone called Hannity and he wants a safe space
__label__-1	"One more company for redcaps to ""boycott"", I guess."
__label__1	So conservative.
__label__-1	Right, with his big smart brain and tiny little hands.
__label__1	I am shocked.
__label__1	No Xi Jinping, I won't meet with you about invading Taiwan until you're nicer to me.
__label__-1	So glen beck is a villain for saying stupid shit and michael moore is a hero for doing the same exact thing?
__label__-1	Hope &amp; Change.
__label__-1	no comrade, you are getting the facts confused again.
__label__-1	The corruption and collusion matter a lot more to me than who was behind exposing it.
__label__1	Satan is sending them here, straight from hell!
__label__-1	If Netanyahu praises something you are doing you should probably take a long hard look at the consequences of your actions.
__label__1	Well when most people do it so will he!
__label__-1	This is gone beyond the wildest dreams of any satirist now.
__label__-1	Good for her
__label__-1	Financially brave with other people's money.
__label__-1	Don't tell me what to do!
__label__-1	Ha ha, British press can afford to tell the truth.
__label__1	Draining the swamp boys
__label__-1	Aaand the regression of what was accomplished the past 8 years officially begins!
__label__1	I thought Reagan smashed the wall
__label__1	Now I see why Repubs dislike Obama, very disrespectful to give a left handed handshake.
__label__-1	For a group that harps constantly about hard work and self-sufficiency, they sure are a needy bunch.
__label__-1	Hillary should get the 'Central Park 5' to join her.
__label__1	Great timing New York State
__label__1	Sending your kid out there to spout your lies is always a great idea!
__label__-1	This just shows how bloated Obamacare is
__label__1	OBVIOUSLY RIGGED
__label__-1	"Say what you want about the absurdity of the mormon religion (i'm an atheist and a minority), but the mormon people themselves are absolutely some of the kindest out there and usually very accepting of differences, regardless of ""official"" positions."
__label__1	But remember, Trump loves the gays.
__label__1	Zeenews.india, sounds totally legit.
__label__1	This DNC scandal is the worst one so far for Trump's campaign!
__label__-1	Tell me more about how Trump changed the doomsday clock
__label__1	praying will cure it
__label__1	As for shilary of course there isn't any emails showing she was actively involved in rigging the primary
__label__1	The ACLU is fake news.
__label__1	I'm sure this thread will be great and have a good discussion.
__label__1	"""Well you see... Bill Clinton had several consensual affairs that spanned 2 decades... I just want to fuck a 10 year old once... he's the real monster""."
__label__1	Wow, the conspiracy is even bigger than we thought.
__label__1	Are they tired of all the winning yet?
__label__-1	Yes in hindsight now that minorities matter in elections I feel I shouldn't have used those words
__label__-1	Is anyone surprised?
__label__1	Yeah Christie's right, things are so terrible there
__label__-1	Haha, now you know that they are worried.
__label__-1	Because American people don't care enough to do anything about it.
__label__-1	What did that woman in Oregon get?
__label__1	It's just light treason.. What's a little treason ever done to harm us?
__label__-1	Gun control won't stop cops from killing black people.
__label__1	Obviously they are telling us that the odds are stacked against Bernie and we need to fight harder to defeat the evil establishment!
__label__-1	"The Obama era database of some 750k DACA ""Dreamers"" has now become a shopping list for Administration 45"
__label__1	But Trump's campaign had nothing to do with Russia!
__label__-1	To quote from EVE: NOT WINNING FAST ENOUGH
__label__-1	Nah.
__label__1	Nah fuck that I didn't get to see Dinosaurs why should my kids get to see polar bears and penguins.
__label__-1	See how misunderstood that word is amongst conservatives.
__label__1	Because the reason for Microsoft's success is cheap labor, right
__label__-1	Wasko is actually quite deplorable.
__label__1	Classy and appropriate.
__label__1	Pure heritage, nothing racist about it.
__label__-1	"""if you like your doctor you can keep him"" ?"
__label__1	What a great negotiator Trump is
__label__-1	Yeah I do but not before cooking up my fillet mignon
__label__-1	Guy is doing homework the night before it's due.
__label__-1	Then he will blame the economy and deficit on the Democrats and the same people that voted for him will believe him.
__label__1	He was totes gonna be tough on the Saudis though, unlike Hillary
__label__-1	Of course.
__label__-1	She graduated from the School of Hard Knock Boots.
__label__1	By jove I think he's got it.
__label__-1	Is the new governor worse than Jan Brewer was?
__label__-1	"Oh, look, the people who brought us ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" are now giving us a new insightful and totally trustworthy analysis."
__label__1	Wow just look at all those black people!
__label__-1	I gotta imagine this is definitely making the Christmas letter.
__label__-1	I had forgotten that he was the first to suggest investing social security in the stock market.
__label__1	Holy shit Noam walks with the peasants today!
__label__1	Yeah, who cares if no-one believes the US will stick by it's word.
__label__-1	Maybe we could just get him an x-box or something and he could live out his war game apocalypse fantasies that way instead of in real life.
__label__-1	As much of a big jerk Obama is for all the corporate bailouts and refusing to stand up to the warfare culture and such, aren't you still glad that McCain isn't president?
__label__1	Good job Bernie supporters, those hashtags have really hit Hillary hard!
__label__1	Glad to see the pre-crime unit is in full swing.
__label__1	Finally, the bankers have a voice in Washington!
__label__-1	Please be true.
__label__1	Her childhood of being raised in the most powerful house in the country and attending exclusive private schools, combined with her adult life of living in a multi-million dollar apartment in a very rich area of Manhattan, makes her uniquely qualified to both understand and tackle the problems facing the common folk today.
__label__1	This justified the vote for all of those hardcore conservatives out there.
__label__-1	Swift Boat Chicagoan's for Truth
__label__1	No...he's just lying to the judges so he can get custody, you have to play the game or the Illimanti will get you
__label__-1	Of course they have.
__label__1	Stripes is liberal propaganda.
__label__1	but yeah lets fight for his right to own those guns, makes a lot of sense
__label__1	And Net Neutrality provides 'lousy internet'!
__label__1	They've sold out.. they're just a bunch of RINOS now.
__label__1	Why should we take a leftists word for it?
__label__1	This seems like a legit and non biased study.
__label__1	Now let's elect a Republican president for 2016!
__label__-1	Remember all the people that died and that nobody went to jail.
__label__1	maybe these people should try not getting sick
__label__1	So... he's saying no Pardon for Hillary then?
__label__1	\#GopFiscalResponsibility ^^
__label__1	She's clearly someone who should be president.
__label__-1	Thanks Obama!
__label__-1	Unfortunately, Republicans are immune to facts.
__label__1	stay classy aggies.
__label__-1	"The GOP's never ending war on ""reality""."
__label__1	You Bernie Bros need to just grow the fuck up and accept the corruption and undermining of democracy that has been going on
__label__-1	So they can take advantage of the land's natural resources.
__label__-1	"Call state capitalism ""socialism"" brehs"
__label__-1	good luck proving she knowingly stated a falsehood.
__label__-1	Trump's Base that's how.
__label__1	You're right, everyone should stop protesting
__label__-1	If this goes on, at one point, the world's gonna ask : Iran, Saudi Arabi, China... USA, what's the difference ?
__label__1	hillary confirmed secret lizard person.
__label__1	TL;DR get a job?
__label__1	Thank god, Devos is gonna sleep better at night now
__label__1	Is Paris that place in Colorado?
__label__1	Small price to pay to not be weirded out by people different than you, right Tennessee?
__label__1	MY GOD If anyone needs me, I'll be in my panic room.
__label__1	I love how his advisers were trying to get him to stay away from Lewinsky and this is his response :) who doesn't want a President with the self control of a 5 year old
__label__1	Sure, and motorcycle safety has little bit of abortion rights in it.
__label__-1	Was it you, Manchin?
__label__1	As a CO resident, I feel so much safer now.
__label__1	Wow between the Russian hackers and the FBI, and probably Nazis and white supremacists, I don't know why people bother voting anymore
__label__1	Liberal lies
__label__-1	Ayy lmao [6]
__label__-1	More like he would of been losing billions if he had stayed in business
__label__-1	It could be El Cheeto yelling at his magic 8-ball.
__label__1	I'm sure Madonna is a credible threat.
__label__-1	Can't have a discussion of Obama without bush
__label__1	Well she shouldn't be poor then.
__label__-1	And sadly his supporters love him for it.
__label__-1	The first Republican fail of the new Congress.
__label__-1	"Sickening abuse of ""authority"""
__label__-1	He paused an interview to watch CNN's coverage of him.
__label__-1	Oh man, if that's the case, I'd hate to see what they look like when they're angry!
__label__-1	Good show, luckily they just released the first season on Netflix!
__label__1	Of course the primaries weren't rigged either
__label__-1	That's like a weeks worth of food!
__label__-1	Many businesses have it already, it is already here
__label__-1	"File this one under ""No shit."""
__label__-1	"""Well oiled machine!"""
__label__1	But, the time for unity is now.
__label__-1	SO FUCKED
__label__1	Luckily, alot of them are boomers who voted for trump, so its a self correcting measure
__label__-1	I'm pretty sure holding interest rates lower than real market values falls on the government.
__label__-1	I thing the whole world (minus trump) shares an interest in a huge Trump loss.
__label__-1	Only terrorism most Americans are familiar with is that of the MSM.
__label__1	I'm starting to think Trump is an idiot.
__label__-1	trump is going to have to increase his presidential salary an awful lot to grossly under-compensate for these dramatic losses.
__label__1	seems legit
__label__1	Well we wouldn't want to *prevent* any healthcare problems.
__label__1	All of science is complete fairy tale just there to take you away from your religion
__label__1	The progressive case for Clinton is overwhelming!
__label__-1	Hopefully this will pave the way for a moon base
__label__-1	How kind of the Kremlin.
__label__-1	Blame religion.
__label__-1	that headline is complete shit because it implies that there were ANY unreported terror attacks on the list don't give him a inch
__label__-1	Mhmm sounds plausible
__label__1	i mean, a lot of journalists quickly wrote articles yesterday citing an anonymous source that Trump was going to quit so yea I'd say it is pretty much a reality now.
__label__1	Should've voted more than once, like all the people Trump said did vote multiple times
__label__-1	Damn all those babies born to into poverty are going to love causing a ruckus with all these guns!
__label__1	He can only have them if he promises to personally read each one himself.
__label__-1	Jeb Bush - 'nuff said.
__label__1	"awwww, this is bad, now the breitbart fanboys are going to feel like they have small dicks again and lash out and vote for robo-hitler or something while screaming ""you made us do this!!!"""
__label__1	This just makes him a smart business man, it's Hillary's policies that made it possible!
__label__1	Donald only hires the best people.
__label__1	We all know the only important amendment is the second one though.
__label__1	They just want cigars.
__label__1	They are RINO's!
__label__1	Yeah, I want that kind of ignorance representing me in Congress.
__label__1	Yes, because his legitimacy wasn't in question until just recently.
__label__-1	Did Rick Santorum rape a catholic schoolboy in 1990?
__label__1	And if the press never reports on this list then it is proof that the media is covering this up.
__label__1	If only Scalia were around still and we had a majority of Strict Interpreters of the Constitution on the Supreme Court.
__label__1	Lack of transparency is just what I look for in a president.
__label__-1	"Nonshocker, the most c u c k e d state in the union that had fucking Mitt ""Willard"" Romney as governor doesn't like Trump."
__label__-1	maybe they'll blame the Republicans when we find out Her Majesty's Secret Server was hacked too and the band played on
__label__-1	look at all these dumbasses jumping to conclusions based on the clickbait title instead of reading OP's comment.
__label__1	Almost seems like the democrats should have gone with another candidate that people like....................................... I wish we had one of those....................................................
__label__-1	Only a woman with brain damage would think a green frog with a Mexican name is a white supremacist.
__label__1	Awww poor baby
__label__-1	Okay well he's worth a lot still
__label__1	The republicans must understand that Obama and Clinton aren't responsible for Benghazi because Bush did some things we don't like.
__label__1	$1000 fine for someone on food stamps seems perfectly reasonable.
__label__-1	Ah Ted Nugent, figures that such a *quality* human being loves Trump
__label__1	What a wonderful use of tax money
__label__-1	Hi got higher ratings because the country tunes in to national disasters!
__label__-1	The only thing that conquers hate is love.
__label__-1	Sounds like this will be a level headed committee meeting this morning.
__label__1	You better have forget an
__label__1	But I thought crooked Hillary was the one colluding with the media.
__label__1	Are we allowed to talk about that?
__label__-1	Considering the atrocities the Copts have suffered at the hands of their Muslim countrymen I'm impressed with their willingness to turn the other cheek.
__label__1	Gosh why didn't they come out sooner
__label__1	LNA &amp; PBI airports will be so thrilled to hear that
__label__1	TIL that the NRA is part of the Trump Administration.
__label__1	lock her up!
__label__1	I can't believe liberals would force a woman to live with her abuser.
__label__-1	Bill should just take some Personal Responsibility.
__label__1	THEY WANT THINGS AND STUFF AND HE'S GIVING IT TO THEM!
__label__1	Damn commie!
__label__1	The only acceptable racism, is reverse racism.
__label__1	I am sure Trump was civil and diplomatic.
__label__-1	Because the terrorists put them there
__label__1	Oh yes the donald with all his prosperity has really brought the hellfire over us in the past 40 years.
__label__-1	It's ok, apparently crowd size and lawn signs are what matters.
__label__1	Well you know for that third term, it is going to take a huge pile of cash.
__label__-1	"And yet she still received 3 million more votes than the guy who ""won"" on a technicality."
__label__1	Well at least the rich of america will donate lots of money to support our fellow americans thanks to the tax cuts.
__label__-1	This is somehow Obama's fault, I'm sure.
__label__1	Because if there's anything the Bush administration excelled at, it was counterterrorism
__label__-1	Nicely done!
__label__-1	At this point it wouldn't suprise me if they ordered more development and set aside 10 billion more for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
__label__-1	"The war part was added by that link, he was saying that the propagandizing of today shares some similarities with the propagandizing of the pre-war Nazi's You dont have to have a bumper sticker ""Eat the rich"" to campaign for higher taxes on the wealthy, thats just preaching hate."
__label__1	After being so militantly outspoken on this issue for 26 straight months, I'm sure Fox News will take a long hard look at their journalistic vetting process and really get back to fundamentals on reporting.
__label__1	Oh, but Clinton's such a better candidate than Sanders because she won the *red states that won't matter* in the general election.
__label__1	Why would you want an educated and healthy society when these Mexicans are stealing out tax dollars?
__label__-1	I bet you a coke Trump has vested interests in the Philippines.
__label__-1	lol don't get mad
__label__1	Of course it does.
__label__-1	Probably no one.
__label__1	Those 6% should have there door kicked down by a fully armed SWAT team, be dragged from there home in chains, and have they're kids taken away... because they were growing roses.
__label__-1	Every time she answers a question, her poll numbers drop
__label__1	No because they're a bunch of liberal whiny alt left extremists that removed us from the path God intended as a white Christian Kingdom under the good guidance of the holy King George!
__label__-1	Is this signal to be in the shape of a mushroom cloud over Pyongyang?
__label__-1	I'm sure all the child rapists are happy about this, they should be expecting pardons based on Schilarys past actions.
__label__-1	Only The Boss Bruce Springsteen can interpret; Born In The USA!
__label__-1	Trump must be truly desperate to have gone from kicking toddlers out of his rallies to pretending he can stand the sight of them.
__label__-1	I am an American, and I **DON'T** care about his tax returns
__label__1	Thanks, but I'll wait for the unskewed version of this poll.
__label__1	But he doesn't support down ballot candidates!
__label__-1	Sounds like he's trying to help them.
__label__1	"If Obama really cared about 'Murica, he'd go out there personally and punch those brown people in the FACE while John Cougar's ""R-O-C-K in the U-S-A"" played!"
__label__-1	Shhh no don't.. Let her lose
__label__1	what a wonderful user history
__label__-1	Shadow president bannon is destroying trump's muslim ban.
__label__-1	Glenn's new meds are working splendidly.
__label__-1	So is this related to DNC or Hillary or Podesta hacks
__label__1	I bet if you drilled down into the meaning or implications of those vacuous words, you'd find a lot of agreement.
__label__-1	Trump has the best pivots!
__label__1	Here's to you Peter Thiel!
__label__-1	Lol fat chance, if she releases anything it's going to be after the primaries
__label__-1	And the Great Cleaving continues.
__label__-1	*leans into microphone*
__label__1	Thank goodness we're fucking all of these voters over so that one or two people don't get to vote more than once!
__label__1	Oh boy, he's gonna be pissed when she doesn't sign it.
__label__1	Exactly fuck the poor right they don't need healthcare, shouldnt get sick while being poor
__label__1	This isn't fake fucking news or anything.
__label__1	He doesnt really care, he can just move back to Kenya.
__label__1	Yeah, just add this to the list of all his other broken campaign promises he didn't even bother to fulfill.
__label__1	Both sides are fucked ..... so VOTE REPUBLICAN!
__label__1	With someone as competent as Comey in charge of the FBI I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of this quickly.
__label__1	But remember folks... the GOP isn't bigoted, and certainly care about the rights people!
__label__1	Shocker!
__label__-1	I'll get downvoted, but Assange deserves it for releasing the identities of agents and if he really did assault those women.
__label__1	Those gosh darn black people just don't know what's good for them.
__label__1	Totally sure Trump is quaking in his boots.
__label__1	Lmao and she's doing such a wonderful job
__label__-1	That's why they voted Republican.
__label__-1	Shocking.. The voice of the neo-nazis (alt-right) aligns with Trump over a civil rights leader.
__label__-1	Maybe there is a dossier about him at Lubyanka Square.
__label__1	Definition of Traitor: Someone who betrays their government (betraying citizens does not count.)
__label__-1	1st rule of the patriarchy: It's always women's fault.
__label__-1	It's about damn time that the single most important detail contained in any correspondence exchanged in the course of this campaign, privately or publicly, made it into a fucking headline about this.
__label__-1	How about Saudi donations to Clinton or the Israel lobby?
__label__-1	CLEARLY German soldiers.
__label__1	I'm sure that'll go through...
__label__-1	The beauty of checks and balances!
__label__-1	Family values
__label__-1	what a great group of people, nice christians.
__label__1	So glad Hillary used her convention to showcase new talent like Obama had the opportunity in 2004.
__label__-1	This sounds dumb as fuck and impractical but i don't know enough about the topic to refute it.
__label__1	I wonder why they're the first!
__label__1	What about Benghazi?
__label__1	So he's quitting, right?
__label__-1	The gaffes.
__label__1	Checkmate, atheists.
__label__1	If them terrsts can smuggle boxcutters aboard a plane and bring down WTC, they sure as shit can fake birth certificate!
__label__-1	Kind of like how Democrats only care about war and human rights when Republicans are in power?
__label__-1	I like the word 'exploits' - because I think its wrong to blame Russia for 'brainwashing' people - they are exacerbating sentiments that are already there
__label__-1	This sub quoted RT all the time during the primaries.
__label__-1	What are you saying, he is just a temporarily embarrassed millionaire!
__label__1	Yeah, it is limited to Christianity.
__label__1	Yes, 9/11 was a total picnic compared to... giving people equal rights.
__label__-1	And with a 37% approval rating and the fact that Paul Ryan would suck my dick if he could magically replace Trump with Pence or literally with any other Republican on Earth at this point, I don't see the next few years getting any easier for Trump.
__label__1	If they don't like it they can just go work elsewhere.
__label__1	Rigged polls clearly
__label__1	What a surprise, Scott Walker sucks.
__label__1	What's that?
__label__1	Like he did a great job with CA
__label__-1	It'll take Trump some time to disavow the Nazi party though, he's gotta do some research first.
__label__-1	So what exactly would an unhealthy campaign look like?
__label__1	Abuse the old, abuse the poor, Abuse the children, but leave that worthless engine alone!
__label__1	"Here comes the shitshow to keep his cronies sucked around his cock, next thing he's gonna say is ""Obama set me up"" and then it'll be checkmate."
__label__-1	Christie should resign anyways.
__label__1	America, Fuck yeah!
__label__-1	Seems Chris Christie should keep his mouth closed more often.
__label__-1	Silly ~~Democrats~~ Republicans, thinking the election was a mandate to undo what predecessors did.
__label__1	You keep being you America, we're all so very proud of your right now
__label__-1	So what's really been going on is that our government failed to adapt as technology progressed
__label__1	Eh fuck it, he's already alienated a lot of world leaders, just let him do his thing, right?
__label__-1	I really dont like these unilateral power moves the supreme court can legalize gay marriage on their own (no contact with legislative), and the executive can just make laws without consulting any other branch either the government may be bloated and stodgy, but it needs fixing, versus simply hail-marrying everything
__label__1	Oh my god we are seconds away from Obama and the city of Hamtramck ushering in Sharia Law.
__label__1	Stay classy and honest like you've always been!
__label__-1	He was just threatening to de-operationalize his position in the administration.
__label__-1	At this point anyone is better than Donna Brazile and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
__label__1	If they managed to infiltrate the FBI, they probably managed to infiltrate CNN
__label__-1	Maybe they should stop doing illegal shit.
__label__1	JUST YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK TO TROOP SUPORTIN'
__label__1	Raised white in Kenya right guys?
__label__-1	No shit.
__label__1	I'm sure Julian Assange will have all the information up on Wikileaks immediately.
__label__1	Collecting paychecks from the government is also socialist.
__label__1	But apparently not enough to where Russia can't do it.
__label__1	How is he supposed to pay his mortgage when Obama takes all of his money and gives it to black people?
__label__-1	Why aren't the embassies using red plastic cups, kegs of Budweiser and serving hotdogs for every function, think of the money they would save!
__label__-1	Doesn't this mean that the CIA is compromised too?
__label__-1	This is gold jerry, pure Gold.
__label__-1	BTW, did Trump send his condolences/concerns to Canada yet?
__label__-1	"Well the intelligence agencies should forget to mention when/if an attack is coming at the White House ""President Donald Trump was killed today by a terrorist attack because he ignored intelligence briefings..."""
__label__1	but by all means keep CNN up and running, they are in no way just as biased for her
__label__-1	Trump will soon blame Obama for his high cholesterol, hair loss, and orange skin.
__label__1	Ah yes, segregation was so great.
__label__-1	$4.45 a day for one person isn't all that bad if you avoid the shitty foods
__label__-1	It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, can you say unconstitutional?
__label__-1	Trying to make himself palatable to the Berniecrats in case Hillary is indicted and the DNC throws it to him?
__label__-1	Proposed Solution: introduce branded products Trumpycontin, Trumpanyl, and Trumpodile.
__label__-1	So what
__label__1	See he is proving that they are living in hell!
__label__-1	Math over opinion any day.
__label__-1	How can anyone on the plant justify dumping a bunch of shit in fresh water?
__label__-1	"There was talk of some sort of law or regulation years earlier when an 8 year old boy shot himself in the head with a full auto Uzi at a gun range with an ""Instructor"" standing right next to him but apparently even the hint of an age limit is too big of an infringement on our sacred 2nd amendment rights."
__label__-1	draft dodging pieces of shit like Trump normally have the biggest hard on for the military.
__label__-1	A 'Strict Constructionist,' he.
__label__1	What an awesome presidential candidate - blames everything on everyone else.
__label__-1	"I like Cruz, but I do not believe he qualifies as 'Natural Born""."
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__1	That is the type of president the US needs a caring and loving abuela.
__label__-1	"Its obvious that ""insert democrat"" is better then ""insert republican"" because only ""insert republican"" is a big doo doo head and CTR is paying me good money to say this."
__label__-1	Why does she need so much money against a guy who is barely running ads?
__label__-1	Trump voters side with the remnants of the KGB over American citizens.
__label__1	'People will die' with Obamacare.
__label__1	That's a shocker.
__label__1	Don't worry based pedes, he's just saying that because he wants the MSM to run with it and then.... uhhmmmm... and then, wellllll... MAGA!
__label__-1	Ahhh CEOs are the anti christ...making sure the business stays afloat to pay its employees.
__label__-1	Bloody tossers, the lot, as brits would say.
__label__1	Here you go, you forgot this.
__label__1	Suddenly you realize people are crazy.
__label__1	Seems like Chomsky and Hersh agree... if I were the establishment, I wouldn't worry about it, since they've never been right before.
__label__1	"Right, I'm sure raising the minimum wage, making public colleges tuition-free, and creating a public option to save us from the ACA death spiral would not ""explode"" the national debt at all..."
__label__1	You guyz just havent given him a chance
__label__-1	"From the people who think saying ""Black Lives Matter"" means other lives don't matter."
__label__1	He was definitely thinking it was the North American Marlon Brando Look-alike Association, durrrr
__label__-1	I'm deeply scared for myself and my community over the next four years.
__label__1	Alex Jones is *clearly* misinformed, it's Hillary that gets people assassinated.
__label__-1	By that logic couldn't I sue the US Navy for all the planes that fly over my house on the way to and from the Naval air station near by?
__label__1	They don't matter once they leave the uterus!
__label__-1	All I can say is 'Lol'
__label__1	C'mon guys, whats wrong with the ceo of one of the largest oil companies in the world who has strong russian oil interests?
__label__-1	Call Mel Gibson on his hotline.
__label__-1	Al Fraken is taking over reddit
__label__1	I'm sorry nope - Hillary Clinton hasn't been a complete paragon of liberal purity and hasn't always supported everything Bernie told me that I should support since the beginning of time so I won't fall for this blatant pandering
__label__-1	Wonder how long it's going to take for them to figure out how badly they got played.
__label__1	But Hillary is the one that will say anything to get elected.
__label__-1	Good lord... my chart is the exact opposite of this.
__label__-1	That's a lot of condoms.
__label__1	Nah, it will be fine because he's playing 12d Parcheesi.
__label__1	I bet Hillary totally hasn't done that.
__label__-1	Never forget: It is present day Republicans that we have to hold responsible for Trump's on-going train wreck to destroy the nation.
__label__1	I'm glad we've allowed the current and past Presidential policies to invite child pornographers, thieves, and perverts into the security theatre.
__label__-1	Many of whom have been Muslim for over a thousand years.
__label__-1	Here comes the Liberals to tell them they are wrong because they are not white.
__label__-1	America first
__label__-1	Most Trump supporters go to a Trump rally just for the chance to sucker punch a black protester.
__label__1	Yes, because decreasing the amount of money in the average person's pockets is sure to increase demand.
__label__-1	99% certain all these people support TPP and NAFTA.
__label__-1	"Do you by any chance know what the term ""structural unemployment"" means?"
__label__-1	I'm a celebrity listen to me
__label__-1	The Great Unfriending of 2016
__label__1	But Sharia law will be upon us soon enough
__label__1	but, but... he will save us from evil Hillary, who only supports 12$ minimum wage, she is clearly the worst
__label__-1	Big surprise.
__label__1	Typical liberal snowflake.
__label__-1	Has issue with more men than women, ends up killing more women.
__label__1	Leave it to old non-white non-liberal women to F this up
__label__-1	His refusal of money is also a reason that the nursing staff at smaller hospitals don't get raises in pay.
__label__-1	"You don't think they'll like his ""spin around and show me whatcha got"" platform?"
__label__1	And there's also absolutely no way Russia interfered in the election.
__label__1	Everyone knows these polls are not how the public really feels.
__label__-1	I'll bet her freinds from the homeland will be waiting for juciy Intel she can share with them.
__label__1	By all means, let's elect this woman President.
__label__-1	Thanks vox, we've known for a decade.
__label__-1	Shut up and go away - I say this a democrat.
__label__1	we didn't really need public schools anyway.
__label__-1	The first excuse post today!
__label__1	You only have the freedom to have married procreative sex.
__label__-1	YESSSSS
__label__-1	Republicans: Dragging us back into the 12th century.
__label__1	Speaking is a privilege.
__label__-1	male prostitutes and cheap, domestic vodka
__label__-1	Christ would have rejected them too!
__label__-1	Bernie isn't.
__label__-1	lol see you on the front page, it's like he reads the top Reddit commend about BLM on how to respond to BLM
__label__1	That's racist!
__label__1	"""Thank God for a cyber terrorist network stealing and leaking state secrets and jeopardizing our national security."""
__label__1	More brilliant ideas from the Trump campaign.
__label__-1	"This deal sounds like ""economic recovery theater"""
__label__1	I'm so ready for women to start preforming abortions on themselves with coat hangers, that will be great!
__label__-1	Not being able to force normal people to humour your fetish does not equate to a crackdown on your rights.
__label__1	This guys was elected cause he smart.
__label__-1	And when the drug war stops and everyone is in driverless cars all that shit is done for.
__label__1	Yeah but he told them to cut it out.
__label__-1	Yes, I've heard.
__label__-1	These kids need jobs.
__label__-1	yeah, because of the two Trump is the clear threat not hold onto it what a dummy this guy is
__label__1	Well as long as reasonable people are in charge.
__label__1	Yes, because what this country needs more of right now is more pendulum swinging.
__label__1	But you can't cut the TSA and it's funding from the budget.
__label__1	Blame Obama
__label__1	That David Brooks is quick on the uptake, isn't he?
__label__-1	When the rich leaves America, the country's just going to sink and drown.
__label__-1	People with the technical know how need to be making copies of these websites
__label__1	So with the 3 million illegal votes factored in, Trump still won the popular vote!
__label__1	Such *patriots*, right?
__label__-1	fix your headline.
__label__1	It's better to stop 45,000 innocent people from voting than to allow a single fraudulent vote
__label__1	But it's not about race, because its never about race, right?
__label__1	Thank you Politifact, where would all be without you.
__label__1	I'm sure we'll be getting single payer any day now.
__label__1	Yes, Trump is notorious for taking no heed of any criticism of him
__label__-1	It wasn't about buying the fucking country you fucking douchebag.
__label__1	At least the chocolate cake is *beautiful*
__label__-1	Raise your hand if you're surprised
__label__1	Call all of these Senators immediately!
__label__-1	Then why did we do it in 1988?
__label__1	Fixing it would ruin all the hard work the Republicans have done
__label__-1	Christ, does he have no shame at all?
__label__1	Well, that should help his poll numbers.
__label__1	But he held the flag that one time!
__label__1	Have scientists been able to determine the color of the sky on Trump's planet?
__label__-1	Nailin palin.
__label__-1	This is... satire?
__label__-1	A soft pussy grab
__label__1	The tea party would call him a CINO (Catholic In Name Only)
__label__-1	This just goes to show that both sides are only concerned with politics--not what is right or wrong.
__label__-1	Dogecoin did it first.
__label__-1	Under budget, ahead of schedule.
__label__-1	So *that's* how we wound up with Boehner as Speaker.
__label__1	Of course we need more career politicians.
__label__1	Well, that will win the GOP support of most latino voters.
__label__1	NO!
__label__-1	I love how democrats turned on him for giving Hillary anything less than a 99% chance of victory.
__label__1	Yeah, give it to the party with real female leaders like Palin and Bachmann!
__label__-1	All fire and brimstone
__label__1	that's what the Constitution is for
__label__1	I'm sure it's only because of all of those illegals who voted.
__label__1	I wonder why this guy doesn't have a real job anymore
__label__1	Bold strategy here, rather than focusing on the issues lets just double down and blame more groups of people.
__label__1	Yeah so when I heard this suggestion years ago it was her too I bet
__label__1	You don't understand, it's all about intent to blaze it
__label__-1	that's a bad look marco
__label__1	"Spicer said she's been ""counseled""... Justice at its finest!"
__label__1	Go ATF!
__label__-1	"""suspend"""
__label__-1	president ~~Donald Trump~~ bannon is no longer the shortest-serving US President in history
__label__-1	Vp selections might be more important that usual this time around--although Biden literally wasn't allowed to do anything and was completely a joke
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__-1	This is news AND political?
__label__1	Because he's got so much more info than the FBI does.
__label__1	Just like Bill, that will destroy the economy and drive up deficits, just like Bill
__label__1	Hope she wins the election!
__label__-1	Isn't the TPP ready for fast track approval for the next president?
__label__-1	A tweet is about as political as this sub.
__label__1	I've always said that the most genuine opinion any reporter can obtain from anyone is from a lobbyist while you're buying him lunch.
__label__1	A $300 fine will really deter lobbyists from violating the state ethics rules
__label__1	Yeah man - now if only Jimmy Fallon could raise good points while still being wacky and likable!
__label__-1	He's not even pretending gun control is about crime or public safety anymore.
__label__-1	Doing it when Russia was actually communist?
__label__-1	"""Freedom loving"" fascist"
__label__1	Obama the divider.
__label__-1	Kind of proves his point doesn't it?
__label__-1	I am going out on a limb here and say that they will punish as many people responsible for this as they punished people responsible for the 2008 crash.
__label__1	Stay classy GOP
__label__1	Wow, nobody has ever broken a treaty before.
__label__-1	Let me guess...NRA and KKK as well?
__label__-1	That's one of the stupidest deflections from Spicer yet.
__label__1	Surely this will affect the polling numbers.
__label__1	Good thing, because all I want to know is what Trump is saying/repeating.
__label__-1	I guess folks might not be getting their checks this year.
__label__1	If you can't afford healthcare, you can't afford to donate to Trump, therefore you are irrelevant.
__label__1	Washington Post is throwing all caution to the wind and jumping on speculation and innuendo because we know someone somewhere knows something.
__label__-1	More terrifying than the stuff Putin is responsible for?
__label__1	But don't worry this will never happen if we go back to the gold standard for our money!
__label__-1	Not sure what difference it makes.
__label__1	Seems like obamacare figured out all the problems ahead of time.
__label__-1	And we give them trillions for the privilege of pilfering the economy.
__label__-1	Have you found any yet?
__label__1	How frustrating it must be to be the President and not be able to even enjoy a quiet game of golf without some big mouth somewhere making a big deal out of it.
__label__1	The important thing to remember is that it is wrong to say that racism motivates hatred towards the president, and that the image of a black man hanging is equally not racist.
__label__1	You mom obviously makes too much.
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__1	Try looking for them in Texas.
__label__1	Thanks Donald!
__label__1	The gift that keeps on giving.
__label__-1	Then we all better vote, right?
__label__-1	Yeah, like FOX cares about honesty.
__label__-1	Elected three times by Wisconsin
__label__-1	Wtf is he doing in Worcester lol.
__label__-1	Yo Bill... buy off the hairy orange and step in - it's a fucking free for all now, may as well... His kids running the government, the republicans making up the most preposterous shit imaginable because they've got no one to tell them to sit down and shut the fuck up, people in cabinet positions whose only goal it is to shut down their departments because those departments and their companies have been at odds for decades... And here comes a huge (YUGE) tax break for the rich which will fuck each and every working American with the largest debt in recorded history... This isn't a government - this is a fucking clown car with an endless stream of clowns climbing out and saying something even more stupid than the last.
__label__1	It'll stop white genocide
__label__1	Sure, but how many people responded to this poll illegally?
__label__-1	Dems lost because they forced an uncharasmatic career politician on a group of voters that want nothing to do with the two party system.
__label__-1	May God help us all.
__label__-1	Anyone has a link to the poll methodology?
__label__-1	Welfare queens.
__label__1	Because Communism.
__label__-1	We'll be making history this November...either our first female president or our first pedophile president.
__label__-1	another liberal communist fascist muslim attack on America's Job Creators
__label__-1	Wow, I thought I lived in a racist shithole.
__label__1	Gee... no one saw this coming.
__label__1	The voting machines were stolen by the Obama shadow government to be used by the Obamacare death panels to decide who gets deported to the FEMA camps, duh.
__label__-1	what other states generated taxes on marijuana?
__label__1	While we're at it, let's bring back child labor.
__label__-1	*cough* Anti-Second Amendment Judge *cough*
__label__-1	And he probably would've bounced it
__label__1	He's constructing a wall
__label__1	I'm glad to hear that, because this is important and it's a significant problem that needs solving.
__label__-1	What's the problem, precedent has been set.
__label__1	'This is just good business'
__label__1	Nice reasoned, intellectual speech by Ben Carson, as per usual.
__label__-1	what would they know!
__label__1	CONSPIRACY!
__label__-1	This is an easy lawsuit.
__label__-1	Bannon's mouth is watering for an attack on US soil.
__label__-1	So they are against the for the most part justified aborting of babies, but will kill doctors to make a point?
__label__1	Jeff Sessions is totally not a lying racist scumbag and I believe 100% of what he says
__label__-1	I have never understood how requiring you to prove that you are who you say you are is discriminatory.
__label__-1	+7 with Mitt's favorite pollster Ouch
__label__-1	"By ""voting mechanisms"" does he mean ""bridges?"""
__label__-1	Finally a pro-Trump article on this sub.
__label__1	You mean Brexit wasn't a good idea in the long or short run?
__label__-1	The primary driver for this gap in pay is because woman stay in their positions longer then men.
__label__1	Well I guess I should have voted McCain
__label__1	But...bu...bu...4chan pulled one over the MSM, right?
__label__1	The man definitely has his priorities in order.
__label__-1	When will idiots learn that most people DON'T WANT TO CARRY AROUND A GUN.
__label__-1	If I were Dudley I wouldn't be going out to eat for a while.
__label__1	Ahhh the party of fiscal responsibility
__label__-1	trump stop following 1920s economic policy that died with hoover
__label__1	Yeah i cant think of one thing thats harder for muslims than white people
__label__1	Trump will definitely win the woman vote this way!
__label__-1	"Immediately after the racial slur he looks round with a huge grin on his face, like ""everybody probably thinks i'm the most smart person with good, good, very good jokes"""
__label__-1	But Hillary voted for something once, so the depression was her fault!
__label__-1	Parent of the year.
__label__-1	Reagan was one of the worst presidents in modern times.
__label__1	Needs more trickle down
__label__1	Very wise to assume one political party can solve all of our problems
__label__-1	there are no such mistakes, this is planned thieving by people of authority
__label__1	Trump is so sexist nominating a female vice president
__label__1	"It's probably a coverup so that when issac wreaks havoc on Tampa and knocks down a bridge conservatives can blame ""liberals"" rather than the fact that we barely spend any money on infrastructure"
__label__-1	"Is the DNC really going to go with ""I know you are but what am I?"""
__label__1	No conflict of interest here.
__label__1	This will of course solve the problem of unemployment among college graduates.
__label__-1	I find it very amusing that people are willing to vote for Bachmann.
__label__-1	i blaze it every day to stick it to obama
__label__-1	Probably because even Danny Devito is personally registering voters
__label__-1	I would be impressed if Don wins four states.
__label__-1	Man that's harsh, especially considering Trump's own son has difficulties.
__label__-1	Texas shits on the separation of church and state clause of constitution every day, this is just another step in the wrong direction
__label__-1	What a fuck.
__label__-1	This man is a danger to society.
__label__1	Yeah, Democrats always cross party lines.
__label__1	When did he start doing that?
__label__-1	Doesn't appear to me she's trying to be the leader at this point.
__label__1	If only all the other democracies that failed had remembered to write checks and balances into their constitutions!
__label__1	I can tell by your comment that it's impossible for you to understand this... you have to be defeated....
__label__-1	No surprise there, when you have a blatant propaganda channel like BBC being forced onto the populace.
__label__-1	A large collection of white people is automatically racist?
__label__-1	Daily reminder that this is an anti-Trump story, and there are no pro-Trump comments, thus proving that we're all shills.
__label__-1	"""THERE SHALL BE NO JUSTICE FROM THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MUHAHAHAHAHAHA"" - Jeff Sessions"
__label__-1	There is something deeply wrong with the American right wing.
__label__1	But I thought Hillary was the one that was going to start a war.
__label__1	Because the lame-stream, drive-by, **conservative** media does not like to bring attention to environmental damage done by the fossil fuel industry because you know, man can't effect the environment or atmosphere.
__label__1	Why can't we teach both theories and kids can decide for themselves?
__label__1	Yeah, he would handle the constant criticism that a president gets really well.
__label__-1	You can thank white voters for pretty much everything in America.
__label__1	No guys this is good now he can go back to prosecuting those damn 9/11 terrorists.
__label__1	Yeah, because Sanders is a reliable, knowledgeable person to talk to about economics!
__label__-1	6 out of 11,065, which even if Bernie had won all of them, means Hillary would have won.
__label__-1	History warns us about socialism and communism.
__label__1	Trite dismissal, I'm shocked, just shocked.
__label__-1	Thanks Trump for helping these terrorists!
__label__-1	Is this sub really that fucking stupid?
__label__1	Shit like this is definitely how we move forward.
__label__-1	So long as his son is being pardoned the same as any other citizen in similar circumstances, this isn't news.
__label__-1	Can you effectively monitor Iran's nuclear activities if you don't have access to its military sites?
__label__1	Yes but what did druge and breitbart say...we can only trust them.
__label__1	Yeah the guy who wants to start a war with Russia is TOTALLY sane
__label__1	That makes him smart.
__label__1	It's not like we needed that money for infrastructure or anything.
__label__1	Hope that we can ban Muslims and deport millions!
__label__1	Thank God
__label__-1	Oh please they have their fucking dicks in their hands.
__label__1	But Mexican americans waving mexican flags are the real traitors!
__label__-1	Wish I was more surprised...
__label__-1	Well I guess that means he is the nomination now right?
__label__1	That makes her smart!
__label__-1	"""We were just playing tummy swords!"""
__label__-1	Serious question what does Biden have to do to convince people he's not running?
__label__1	Because he is the future.
__label__-1	"Also George Takei: ""Oh, my!"""
__label__-1	Trump 2016
__label__-1	TEH MUZLIN!
__label__-1	It appears the alt-right is always the person a conservative is pointing their finger at.
__label__-1	If you fill the swamp with enough shit, is it still a swamp?
__label__1	I totally did not see marijuana legalization in Colorado causing problems in the justice system.
__label__-1	Is it sanctions?
__label__1	Man she's just like a regular new yorker, I guess I was wrong about support sanders.
__label__1	Oh come on, those things in other countries do not count as humans, do they?
__label__-1	This is fascism, if you agree that the editor should be jailed you are a fascist.
__label__-1	"""Do you have anyone living in your home with severe mental illness?"""
__label__1	Nothing suspicious here, nope, no way.
__label__1	Clearly an assassination attempt by pro-Trump police officers.
__label__-1	And the democrats let them.
__label__-1	Just a couple of weeks ago Trump spoke to Cubans in Florida promising them he would reverse Obama's opening of ties with Cuba and rejecting the idea of lifting the embargo.
__label__1	So we need to add an extra tax of 50% of the income to all GLBT to pay for this.
__label__-1	Wat in the world is this lol
__label__1	No, if he does it he's a Nazi
__label__1	owned by the good ol' Charles Koch foundation
__label__1	Yes, he is literally Hitler.
__label__-1	Unions say lots of dumb things.
__label__-1	I'll be honest....I never knew in my 18 years of living that private prisons were a thing
__label__1	"""internet experts"" So basically reddit."
__label__-1	She did say stuff about trump that was false.
__label__-1	Guise your helping clinton by posting this!
__label__-1	Good
__label__-1	By the way, before y'all downvote, I mean this as a negative about his plan.
__label__-1	"Pretty awful attempt at ""satire"" or, alternatively, purposeful muddying of the water."
__label__1	Yeah, that's not a biased source at all.
__label__-1	What a pathetic man.
__label__1	watch as all the wealthy people leave their beachfront California mansions and their Manhattan penthouses in order to move to Kansas and take advantage of this sweet deal!
__label__1	Ah man I rooted for Lenin in the apprentice.
__label__1	It didn't work in one state so it'll never work anywhere!
__label__1	Hahahaha, 'start to'... maybe these will stick
__label__-1	Comrade Trump will not tolerate unwanted opinions.
__label__-1	"She's a black woman so Kellyanne Conway can use her as an example of ""diversity"" in the administration."
__label__-1	Every time I hear about this guy I automatically think of Dan Egan in Veep.
__label__1	He probably means the Republicans, with their policies to make voting difficult for minorities.
__label__-1	Tl;dr: Black America is doing just fine and doesn't need any help from Trump.
__label__1	... happy days are here again
__label__-1	You don't need to start a witch hunt after your epic election loss if you're not spying on your political enemies.
__label__1	Because Paul Ryan, who still supports but does not actively campaign for Donald Trump, would be worth 7 points nationally if he were on the campaign trail.
__label__1	What a classy bunch
__label__1	Thanks Kentucky, for re-electing McConnell.
__label__1	Fake news!
__label__1	Trump's winning so much, the wins are cancelling each other out, creating the illusion of loss
__label__-1	I guess everything is equal now.
__label__-1	#WhichHillary is tending keep it going!
__label__-1	"I guess ""extreme vetting"" and ""everything will be America First"" now includes consulting with foreign countries on what they'd prefer we do."
__label__1	He's not too worried, in 2020 he'll have 95% of the black vote so no biggie
__label__-1	"He tweeted the following: ""If McDonalds brings back the Chicken Fajita and the McRib, I'll definitely turn myself over."""
__label__-1	A little late there bud.
__label__1	But the electoral college is about making sure everyone's vote matters, no matter where they live, guys.
__label__1	What climate change webpage?
__label__1	What the fuck would this Carl Bernstein hack, whoever the hell he is, know about any of this.
__label__1	I'm sure this is somehow the fault of the media
__label__1	He wasn't upset about her appearance, it was her lack of stamina.
__label__-1	I suspect Donald would make us build them ourselves.
__label__1	Wow Kasich really brought the facts on this one.
__label__1	So glad they care!
__label__1	I've looked into the future, it's the liberals fault.
__label__1	Who knew that exorcism wasn't an effective way to eliminate the state's deficit?
__label__-1	He wants to help the poor like the Bible says, how misguided of him!
__label__1	Obama, what a sellout!
__label__-1	I'm surprised his running mate isn't Mike Jeffries then.
__label__1	But with her being on mandatory leave from work, Mom had plenty of time to MAKE her daughter a costume.
__label__1	What're you talking about, he hires 51 women at a time at least once a year.
__label__-1	Fuck Nigel Farage and everything about him.
__label__1	Something something Jews controlling the media
__label__-1	I'm starting to think Trump may be a liar.
__label__-1	Record requirements for SEC compliance.
__label__-1	He's going to get a cramp in his grabbin' hand.
__label__1	A true supporter of free speech and freedom of press.
__label__1	Hoo boy she is going to lose now
__label__-1	lol...what an asshat.
__label__-1	Blank Check Barry and Wimpy Reid continue to refuse to negotiate their ransom demands as the Bammy Barrycade Brigade National Hostage standoff enters its 5th day.
__label__-1	random
__label__-1	Thank god Donald's handlers took away his Twitter access or he'd be at war with a disabled kid.
__label__-1	American small business owners profit off of cheap labor, and I bet we can all guess who they are voting for
__label__1	It's ok cuz why wouldn't we want to be better friends with Turkey!
__label__-1	At this point, I'm not sure who would be a less corrupt and trustworthy president, Hillary Clinton or Al Capone.
__label__1	Fuck you, he's a reddit HERO because he took down Gawker, how DARE you besmirch his name.
__label__1	When they go low we go lower
__label__1	Both parties are the same!
__label__-1	Are you at all concerned that your headline is not supported by *anything* in the linked article?
__label__1	I think it is good for the kids to learn how the police will be treating them later.
__label__-1	Most people don't even know = I just learned
__label__-1	Maybe he can order a round of nukes with his dessert.
__label__1	Please stop oppressing religion with your round world theories
__label__-1	American democracy at work lol
__label__-1	No, it's the end of what old, rural, ignorant white people *think* America is.
__label__1	He must be a closet liberal.
__label__1	TIL the best way to increase economic development is to pull funding from educational programs
__label__-1	She wants to stop you from doing what she does.
__label__1	In a society where corporations are considered people with first amendment rights, I don't see why churches shouldn't be.
__label__1	Donald Trump, already destroying civil rights before he even has the power to do so!
__label__-1	two shit heads doing the wrong thing
__label__1	Raising the level of discourse yet again
__label__-1	Sanders!
__label__-1	TIL there are jobs which offer more than 10 dollars an hour
__label__1	Yeah when can get back to looking for the birth certificate, amirite Tennessean?
__label__1	Yup, every minimum wage job is held by teenagers.
__label__-1	The ride never ends.
__label__1	Because now everything will change.
__label__-1	Yes, Joe IS a derp.
__label__1	Classy...really classy.
__label__-1	I like to see these even if Trump is losing, it will be fun to watch them change over the next 6 months
__label__1	Never trust anyone who wears wooden shoes!
__label__-1	"""Why did you hate trump so much, he's governing as a moderate"""
__label__1	**Get me my gun......**
__label__1	Let the states handle foreign relations
__label__-1	Not hard to believe since half of US households are now getting government assistance.
__label__1	After only 15 years!
__label__1	Leave these job creators alone!
__label__-1	Their smear campaign against him is that he gives out tons of free money and has developed super potent weed lol.
__label__-1	Claiming that this is a fight for school choice is inaccurate.
__label__-1	I can't wait.
__label__1	Scott Walker thought bubble: when women realize that redefining rape and restricting their access to healthcare is a good thing; we'll be golden.
__label__1	Phew, I am glad we cleared that up.
__label__1	America would never condone such actions!
__label__1	This is total bs because there are actually millions of people in America.
__label__-1	Well, thank God you're completely irrelevant now.
__label__-1	Do you think Donald actually is an autocrat or is he just such a self centered douche bag that he only *acts* like it
__label__1	Yeah, I would much rather have Trump or Cruz!
__label__-1	I never thought I would live to see a nuclear attack... but that feels like a real possibility now.
__label__-1	Excuses from authoritarian wannabes.
__label__-1	I read on Reddit the other day that Arby's employees more people than the coal industry, so yeah.
__label__1	"Who would have thought those ""bad hombres"" might show up and vote."
__label__-1	Go after the superiors too.
__label__-1	Moonies ignoring the real story here - Obama looks cool and casual no matter what he's standing on.
__label__1	it's so not about protecting corporate profits and making sure they don't have to be responsible for the messes they make
__label__1	Yeah, but he didn't give speeches to Goldman Sachs, so it's OK.
__label__1	America has always had the best Congress money can buy.
__label__1	But Hillary coughed, clearly that's more important!
__label__-1	Note that it was with a strongly Republican Congress.
__label__-1	"but according to conservatives, clinton IS ""the left""."
__label__-1	"""the nearly insurmountable delegate math confronting him"" will be moot when Hillary Clinton has charges laid against her as a result of the email server investigation."
__label__-1	President Bannon wastes no time, I see.
__label__-1	Every time he says something incredibly stupid like this I want to punch someone who voted for him.
__label__-1	Kill them all.
__label__1	The tide has now turned.
__label__1	It's not the Muslim terrorists killing people you should be afraid of, no it's Trump for saying he's going to do something about it.
__label__-1	I believe there are many people in this country who think that we are somehow above this type of behavior, thus it couldn't happen.
__label__1	But still better than Hillary, right guys?
__label__-1	Sounds good to me!
__label__-1	So is there any proof of this or just typical CNN bullshitting?
__label__1	But what about all those European countries that are undergoing massive waves of protests to switch to a healthcare system like ours?
__label__-1	To reach the corporate parent... It really is the true goal for any big fiscal change, much as to reach the senate, house/ parliament is the only way to have true social change.. One step at a time
__label__1	It's jet fuel that won't melt steel beams in all the terrorists attacks he's preventing.
__label__1	This is why I get my news from the Bible and not TV/Magazines
__label__1	"""You all know that the 3rd Saturday in January is protest day, right?"""
__label__-1	\/d
__label__-1	Wonder who's words he's going to plagiarize?
__label__1	he wasn't choked to death - it was his anti-police rhetoric that killed him...
__label__1	Nothing suspicious here.
__label__-1	This is absolutely hilarious but clearly false and fake since it reflects negatively on the don... Lol.
__label__1	Trump hires only the best people!
__label__1	Yay, democracy.
__label__1	Riiight... not at all like Trump himself.
__label__-1	Is that compared to the Irish slaves that outnumbered them or the black slave owners that bred more black slaves?
__label__-1	Mathematics has a liberal bias.
__label__-1	Well if you want to manage your finances, Wallstreet alums are the best in the business, they should be picked to run the fed and the treasury too.
__label__1	100% of Democratic voters definitely want Hillary to be their presidential nominee.
__label__-1	This makes me sick to my stomach.
__label__1	"An exemplary display of his purported ""Christian Values""."
__label__-1	He does it so when he goes home he doesn't have to beat his kids.
__label__-1	Would be nice if those were the results of..oh..say...prop 19.
__label__-1	How about they don't fund stuff on a state level... let people fund what they want
__label__-1	"Our version of society is so fucked up that this almost doesn't even count as ""ironic""."
__label__1	Besides, he doesn't recall what they talked about, so it's not like it matters anyways
__label__-1	I hope so
__label__1	You'd all just be falling for Dawood Ibrahim's ploy to convert the US to Islam by making people register as Muslim in protest.
__label__-1	That is great.
__label__1	Superdelegates are the most democratic thing I've ever heard of
__label__1	So republicans think god is not great.
__label__-1	It's like poetry, it rhymes.
__label__1	If Hillary doesn't need internet security, why should you?
__label__-1	Well yeah, gas turbine plants are far more efficient and can easily adujust their production to match the need beyond the baseline nuclear output and growing solar and wind production.
__label__-1	None of us are surprised at what comes out of Trump's mouth but this one is really fucked up.
__label__-1	Bingo
__label__1	And Democrats are ever so concerned about respecting traditions.
__label__1	"""but sheriff badges are totally fine!"""
__label__1	What he actually he said was that he would use campaign money to fund himself.
__label__1	*_I think he should seek a declaratory judgment._*
__label__-1	Rest easy as I need my pool cleaned....then I will kick you out.
__label__-1	A thousand year reich?
__label__-1	I'm still baffled how he is a brilliant surgeon, he said some really stupid shit.
__label__1	Arresting more people for smoking weed should solve that, though
__label__1	"There he goes ""getting uppity"" again!"
__label__-1	Way to high.
__label__-1	Shows how useless US intelligence is, even with its bloated budgets and numerous agencies, or perhaps they're not much changed since 9/11 and still don't coordinate
__label__-1	Can we keep him in office?
__label__-1	Wow.. 1337 comments as I check this :)
__label__1	Yea ok
__label__-1	Transgenderism is a mental disease.
__label__1	Obviously a false flag.
__label__-1	The best part of Hillary's email scandal is that I've been hearing 'Benghazi' far less.
__label__1	Say what you will, but black unemployment was at record lows during slavery.
__label__-1	Another spectacular article by WAPO
__label__-1	He might not have been the founder, but he sure did give it plenty of food and water and room to grow.
__label__1	It's all so Obama can appoint a super-ultra-liberal to the SCOTUS so they can name him Permanent Supreme High Chancellor.
__label__1	Because Neera Tanden is worth listening to.
__label__1	Except to pay protestors
__label__-1	If a Chris Wallace makes things up in the middle of a broadcast, and no one is around to hear it (because they're all at church), does he still make noise?
__label__-1	If that were the case, Trumpsters would be shambling up and down the streets bitching about how the election was rigged.
__label__1	I expect an immediate, strong reaction from Chaffetz on the oversight committee.
__label__1	Everyone knows that only straight white cisgender men can make fair, unbiased decisions without identity politics getting in the way.
__label__-1	What the fuck is wrong with some people
__label__-1	No one's talking about it because it's a skewed poll by an unreliable/low rated pollster.
__label__1	Because it's a conspiracy obviously
__label__1	Its always a good idea to wait til the last moment.
__label__1	The question is, should Bernie apologize?
__label__1	Too easy, why bother.
__label__1	DID THEY POLL THE EMPLOYEES AND SUBSCRIBERS FIRST?
__label__-1	Who cares, show us trumps.
__label__1	It isn't fascism until the camps start.
__label__-1	I dunno if this is on the same level of Hillary being called too stupid by the FBI.
__label__-1	Go independent
__label__1	Which is clearly a good thing
__label__-1	To anyone with any even small connection to any African American community, this is like saying water is wet.
__label__-1	All those elderly women having abortions!
__label__1	Duh, we all know this is because women can't get pregnant from legitimate rape!
__label__1	You have a right to work, just not a right to earn a living.
__label__1	At least it's not as worse as Hilary's email scandal
__label__-1	GOP outreach to minorities.
__label__1	So the real US leader was in the room, so OK
__label__-1	Microsoft NBC has proven themselves time and time again as more respectable than the mass media, so this is good news.
__label__-1	To be fair- so has the Democrat's.
__label__1	He was just undercover as a drunk driver.
__label__-1	How can Donald Trump be trusted to create jobs?
__label__-1	Please, god, let this be the last we hear of him.
__label__-1	that link/article was worthless
__label__1	Single payer care is why people come from all over the world to the Mayo Clinic in Brandon, Manitoba.
__label__-1	The American people didn't think so it seems.
__label__1	Why not yellow?
__label__1	Because the free market, if left to function all on its own without the meddling of liberals, will perfectly take care of all of God's creations.
__label__1	"""real men"" make death threats"
__label__1	Wow, just think of how many jobs those rich people will be creating now that their taxes are lower, because as Sean Hannity told me.... ten million times, he never got a job from a poor man.
__label__1	Should I delete my browser history now?
__label__1	oh joy
__label__-1	So bring a bottle or a shewee.
__label__1	It's obviously not supposed to be a factual statement, duh
__label__-1	This looks super real
__label__1	There's that R word again.
__label__-1	I don't know how FB works but wouldn't FB be responsible for taking down groups without a real reason?
__label__1	I want to know Melania's thoughts on this.
__label__1	Obama cut it in half!
__label__-1	Where do I upvote Obama?
__label__1	The conspiracy theorists have really taken the lead in the sanders camp, good to see rational thought prevailing over there!
__label__-1	The temperature record, and thermometers, is a hoax from China.
__label__1	But Catholics aren't Christians!
__label__1	I thought Republicans were pro free trade?
__label__1	I guess it's because Texas politicians love the Constitution so much.
__label__-1	For real... :(.
__label__-1	How does the wife know so many details if she wasn't there?
__label__-1	"""Not on my watch..."" said Zombie Reagan in between bites of the exposed brains of the recently slain corpse of a Soviet Russian Communist welfare queen."
__label__1	He obviously wanted to see how high he could pop a wheelie.
__label__-1	GOP - doesn't believe in climate change but believes that hurricanes and such are caused by god because of gays.
__label__1	Because their ideologies are so similar
__label__-1	Kushner's tasked with doing it after he wins the middle east.
__label__1	Yeah I'm sure being a pushover like Bernie attracts the general population much more.
__label__1	We're saved!
__label__1	Omg guyz hillary is totez innocent!
__label__-1	There are at least a 99 problems that are more relevant than the sexual assault (for him being pres, not for him being a free roaming human).
__label__1	Plus a pony for every child.
__label__1	Why do we care what disease her doctor has?
__label__1	Way to go LAPD, surely this will improve your public image.
__label__-1	Send him to the gulag.
__label__1	It doesn't matter who violated your rights or did something illegal as long as the evidence can be twisted to show what I want
__label__-1	And it begins.. Probably to distract from the increasing seriousness of the Russian election interference probe.
__label__-1	I didn't know Wyoming and West Virginia had early voting.
__label__1	The swap is being drained as we speak.
__label__-1	While giving huge tax giveaways to wealthy corporations, I'll bet.
__label__1	And people endorse Hillary because she buys them, threatens them, manipulates them or does them favors.
__label__1	We could publicly admit the need for Militia incuded in the U. S. Constitution was predicated by the need to suppress any rebellion by those grateful to be enslaved black folks.
__label__-1	Next up, Trump Uni-'Merica.
__label__1	Those lazy kids need to reevaluate their moral failures, stop being draining leeches, and pull themselves up by their bootstraps!
__label__-1	Now they notice?
__label__1	Couldn't happen to a nicer person.
__label__-1	Luckily you can travel to any part of Rhode island from any other part of Rhode Island in 15 minutes.
__label__-1	My mommy believes in me and said that I deserve it.
__label__-1	Any idiot who doesn't think we should bring in refugees because they might be terrorists should ask themselves one simple question: If you wanted to go to another country and kill a bunch of people, why would you choose the slowest possible method of getting there?
__label__1	Well that solves the whole overpopulation issue for a bit
__label__1	We are so fortunate to have Trump fighting through those painful bone spurs (which forced him to defer military service) lecture the former dean of the Army War College about military strategy.
__label__-1	If none of you see the irony in this, then I don't want to live on this planet anymore
__label__-1	...And this was how Donald Trump won the 2016 Election, congratulations Democrats, you idiots.
__label__-1	P
__label__1	Should have learned from what happened to Malcolm Tucker and covered the binder!
__label__1	Prostitution and pot is legal and they don't have a military, so I'm thinking it's an actual hell hole.
__label__-1	Could this mean a Presidential run?
__label__-1	Tax cuts were sold as the way to create jobs.
__label__1	aw heck, I was *just* about to put moneys on the President Christie ticket, until this.
__label__1	You hit the nail on the head, 10/10
__label__1	This title was not editorialized at ALL.
__label__-1	Are you really asking a question?
__label__1	Well I hope Hillary and all her supporters get anal fissures after Harambe rapes them
__label__1	That's just gotcha journalism from the librul media.
__label__-1	And HOW exactly is a man responsible for decisions he probably didn't make?
__label__-1	Not surprising from the Taint of America.
__label__1	Nah, it was the Russians
__label__1	45% of those polled are Republicans
__label__-1	Well, time to revert to sending smoke signals.
__label__-1	Clinton was a secret Muslim too?
__label__1	poor people should die!
__label__1	Well, whenever I want guidance on matters that are of a political, or governmental nature, I mostly listen to celebrities, because they always have the best judgement in all things.
__label__1	If we downvote this hard enough it won't be true #feelthebern
__label__1	I'm waiting for the GOP to offer money to people not to vote
__label__1	Get back in the kitchen
__label__1	Really happy that when you turn on the television, these DNC hacks and what they reveal about Hillary Clinton is getting proper coverage and apt investigation
__label__-1	Transistion team says no official word until next week - how often are these reported/expected stories correct?
__label__-1	Carson says he is faces unprecedented scrutiny because the MSM fear him and are disparate.
__label__1	He knew Obama would be a much better president and threw the election?
__label__-1	Also sets new low point for basic decency.
__label__1	The solution here is simple: Code is evil and programming should be outlawed in the United States.
__label__1	Grab your tinfoil has boys and girls, I think he's onto something!
__label__1	But they're not racist.
__label__-1	Finally, a reason for the imaginary number (i) that I can understand
__label__1	Well clearly those windmills are slowing the down the Earth's rotation and that is what is causing these weird climate changes.
__label__1	my heart really goes out to him, he is a true patriot
__label__1	It'll be so damning, they'll *have* to put Hillary in jail!
__label__-1	It's not even BP's well.
__label__1	Oh well, then, if it's become an inconvience to Trump, we just all forget that happened, right?
__label__-1	I guess I am not going to retire after all.
__label__-1	While the Democratic poll numbers for candidates seem to move slowly, it looks like the GOP base jumps from shiny object to shiny object on a weekly basis.
__label__-1	Just like every president before him, since the Pentagon existed, except for maybe Carter.
__label__1	Y'all started it
__label__1	"Well all his cabinet nominations scream ""helping the little guy"" so far"
__label__-1	"Chriss Dodd is just a believer in the ancient definition of ""a honest politician is one who once bought will stay bought""."
__label__-1	So is this good or bad?
__label__-1	2 points if u include 3rd party candidates.
__label__1	Man, Soros is gonna be shelling out the big bucks for his rowdy protestors.
__label__1	Gee I can't imagine why.
__label__1	dang which Republican leaked these ones
__label__1	Fucking dirty dopers should just take xanax or k-pins like a good American
__label__1	CGI
__label__1	They're just exercising their right to open carry.
__label__-1	lol, k
__label__1	Oh no look at the police state of America with their lack of freedom -_-
__label__1	But the email server!
__label__1	Mid convention slump, classic, happens all the time, nothing to see here, move along
__label__-1	Is there a good list of all the legislation that the GOP filibustered over the last 6 years?
__label__-1	Letting media ownership get consolidated into a handful of multinational mega-corps will be seen, by history, as largely a bad move.
__label__1	Glad he is continuing to use our tax dollars wisely!
__label__1	Oh, that completely changes things, he was only going to be racist in private.
__label__-1	Why don't we make high school better?
__label__1	Anyone we don't like should recuse themselves so we can actually implicate them!
__label__-1	"This author apparently doesn't know what the word ""Millennial"" means."
__label__1	It's like her an Trump are both trying to lose the election.. They just keep doing dumb shit.. Hillary widely seen as corrupt, so she picks another politician with a reputation for corruption as potential VP... good move
__label__1	Both parties are the same
__label__1	Who needs competence when you have yesmen amirite
__label__1	And Mexico will pay for it!
__label__-1	He did so non ironically too
__label__1	This is a shocker.
__label__-1	"Let's work on guaranteeing the rights it already asserts, and *then* worry about ""improving"" it!"
__label__1	Give that man a purple heart!
__label__1	FBI clearly stands for Feminist Bashing Institute
__label__1	What a novel thought.
__label__-1	Scum tends to stay near the top, while the good stuff is found below.
__label__1	But they need that money so they can create more jobs
__label__-1	People will say his campaign is a disaster until he wins in November, then they'll just say all the millions of people who voted for him are racist, sexist, xenophobic, islamophic, homophobic, transphobic, and anti-semitic to explain why he won.
__label__1	Yeah Obama really needs a lot of votes for his next Presidential run.
__label__1	No they asked 300 million Americans obviously
__label__1	Crooks have rights too and having lobbyists is a right.
__label__1	My heart just bleeds for him.
__label__-1	Why does the United States of America insist on cannibalizing itself?
__label__1	I wonder what party he belongs to?
__label__-1	Naww, didn't make it to become UKs ambassador but Uncle Murdoch gave him a little job, how nice.
__label__1	He outa punch you right in the face, like a REAL American!
__label__1	I assume Trump supports it.
__label__-1	This Federal Judge is a disgrace to this country.
__label__1	yeah, healthcare in the hands of private profiteering is working out just fine
__label__1	Well, seeing as how Halliburton made $39,000,000,000 from the Iraq war this should really teach them a valuable lesson.
__label__1	Oh yes, this seems to be REAL kosher, because nobody EVER sabotaged another's political career OR travel plans to CONVENIENTLY get them out of the running.
__label__1	Well, you know Hillary, all states border Vermont so you should win in a landslide.
__label__1	'This would be like my form of alcoholism' clearly stating that he is addicted to beautiful women and cannot control his urges around them, first step to recovery right?
__label__-1	What if one dislikes the polices of both men?
__label__-1	France should be more concerned about their government declaring and indefinite state of martial law than religious minorities existing.
__label__1	More subsidized medicine for dead-beats here comes that crazy liberal Christie!
__label__1	But some political T_D geniuses said what she did eclipses watergate, whomever am I to believe?
__label__-1	I think I'm getting the black lung,pop
__label__1	Impecable timing Tom.
__label__1	Theyre just saving us form the liberals
__label__1	I'm sure this will get the attention it deserves in the media.
__label__1	You should know the bombs would only hit the evil Iranians, not the good ones!
__label__1	Poor Slate, they need more training in libertarian economics, not only must every human need provided a profit every step of the path must be profitable if the steps are few, invent some for profit only additions.
__label__-1	/thread
__label__-1	If the goal is to punish / control women, quite easily, as you see illustrated here.
__label__-1	Very disappointed in someone I thought would be the last Republican to say such a thing.
__label__-1	"I'm just waiting for an article titled ""Trump Beat Clinton if Californians and New Yorkers only count for 3/5 of a vote!"""
__label__1	Of course it is
__label__-1	Breaking: Half of all Republicans more conservative than the median Republican
__label__-1	Yeah, because God created a variety of different niche species so man could kill 'em because fuck yeah!
__label__-1	Brownback has to finish what he started in Kansas.
__label__1	Oh yeah Obama, like the candidate you endorsed is so in touch with the middle class.
__label__1	This obviously proves both candidates equally bad.
__label__1	They got to him.
__label__1	I'm sure the corrupt politicains will all support this.
__label__-1	If you were wondering how he was so *sure* that there was voter fraud, now you know.
__label__1	Black = guilty
__label__-1	Karma's a bitch.
__label__-1	Using the USPS would also make it a crime.
__label__1	I am convinced it is an ABC/ Washington post Poll so there would be no bias in that poll would there
__label__1	A Murdock publication, impossible.
__label__1	I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
__label__1	Bernie sanders misogynist extraordinaire.
__label__1	The true threat to America
__label__-1	The shackles have been taken off me!
__label__1	Take that, Trump.

__label__-1	Kessler can be amazingly idiotic.
__label__-1	GOP - you are a disgrace for allowing this to continue.
__label__-1	Nothing in the NYT's article supports the claim that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump's phone.
__label__1	looks like one bad hombre
__label__1	Is this those burdensome regulations that I hear are strangling our economy and thwarting job creators?
__label__1	Jack Ma is a huge fan
__label__-1	It's crazy to think how much of a shitstorm has been created because Trump decided to spend a Saturday morning tweeting bullshit conspiracy theories.
__label__1	Trump is literally hitler!
__label__1	So Presidential.
__label__1	Everyone knows you need large breasts to govern effectively, why even bother putting it on a pin?
__label__-1	Such a fitting tribute
__label__-1	Hence why the Republicans are always cutting education.

__label__-1	*These Fucking Amateurs, Dude*
__label__1	But.. But.. She's a progressive..
__label__-1	The minimum wage is already zero: unemployment.
__label__-1	"Still wants to spend money on NATO to counter Russian ""aggression"" in a part of the world we have no business being in."
__label__1	I'm sure the mods aren't gonna censor any more posts or comments.
__label__1	Damn California republicans screwing thing up for everyone else.
__label__1	They weren't from LifeZette or Breitbart so they obviously weren't really journalists.
__label__1	McMahon might be the right choice; after-all, politics and professional wrestling have a lot in common.
__label__-1	So all of a sudden, a month before election, two women say this happened a decade ago with no proof whatsoever, and we're supposed to just believe them?
__label__-1	Was the interview 14 minutes?
__label__-1	This is the same poll that said Hillary would win right?
__label__-1	Why would Russia help Trump after buying all the uranium mining rights from Hillary?
__label__-1	Illinois is about to get a lot more dangerous
__label__1	"so what's wrong with "" just getting by"", live in the moment amirite?"
__label__1	He did lead them to a mandate from nearly 20% of American voters
__label__-1	The Alabama economy tanked long before *Obama Cared*.

__label__-1	O'Malley is going to reopen his candidacy just for the 50k
__label__1	Great things are happening in God's chosen land.
__label__1	Yeah, but a guy my uncle knows posted something on facebook saying the opposite so who's to say what's true?
__label__1	Dementia is such a sad condition.
__label__1	But, but, but, WikiLeaks emails!
__label__-1	Guess we should have just asked him about *Rampart*
__label__-1	Once born: die.
__label__-1	What about all his victims that didn't survive?
__label__1	"""Obama set us up for this failure!"""
__label__-1	My rep in shining armor.
__label__-1	Is that a lot?
__label__-1	Oh man theres so much open mindedness and well though out discussion on both sides of the issue and certianly no circle jerking at all here.
__label__1	Because that money is put to much more efficient use after being confiscated by government and pissed down a rathole.
__label__-1	They would socialize the fedora sector of the economy.
__label__1	Good thing everybody agrees what kind of country US must become.
__label__1	Yeah, let's increase taxes.
__label__-1	In other breaking news: fire is hot, water is wet.
__label__1	I assume this is because the socialist muslim is making more veterans homeless.
__label__-1	This is why it's important for civilians to film police encounters themselves.
__label__1	If obamacare is more popular than trump, imagine the gap between trump and the affordable care act
__label__1	it's true, winning campaigns replace their campaign managers 3 months before the general election all the time.
__label__-1	It's a eugenics program aimed at wiping out poor people, and it's disguised as health care reform.
__label__1	Oh thank god a story that comes straight from the mouth of Alex jones made it to the front page of r politics twice in one week
__label__1	I'm sure they will help people by putting them in rehab centers, and not in jail
__label__-1	Why can't they just be grateful for the free drugs?
__label__1	I heard if you protest for a week, the president has to step down!
__label__-1	Just for fun, can you tell us *why* it was great and what changed?
__label__1	"That is the flag of the ""Twue Patriots"""
__label__1	Someone just left their Samsung plugged in.
__label__1	"Someone take that commie ""general's"" coat!"
__label__1	Well that's just even more evidence on why they couldn't get anything done,working with an angry person like that!
__label__1	While the rise was all due to Trump, I'm sure that the drop has to be Obama's fault.
__label__1	Yeah...peace, prosperity, and job growth sure are awful.
__label__1	Well at least he is doing a white people drug.
__label__1	Well Bannon is not an illegal so I guess it's ok
__label__1	Are that still going to buy Starbucks and use trumps name but that will really show them how you feel
__label__1	Uh I'm pretty sure it's an embarrassment for the white working class being as they're all KKK supporters.
__label__1	Damn those Russia hackers, they hacked the DNC to reward Clinton loyalists.
__label__-1	BASED
__label__-1	Socialism works for many other nations doing better than us; it is not inherently bad.
__label__1	If we eliminate entitlements and they buy their own money poverty will disappear!
__label__1	This should work out well.
__label__1	But the right wing media!
__label__1	Nah, did you see the size of his inauguration crowds?
__label__1	Great, more taking from those that work the hardest and giving to those that cry the loudest.
__label__-1	Whether or not the opponents of gay marriage believe that the comparison is valid, the issues with regard to the rights of an individual to choose whom the wish to marry are precisely the same as in the Loving case.
__label__1	It would be so much better if we could just start a few more wars...
__label__-1	Tl;dr: Voter ID laws are a solution to a problem no state actually has.
__label__1	I'm sure those women who would not have been able to use the services of medical facilities would agree about a chance to fix it later and not live with the consequences.
__label__1	Incorrect, Don't you know that they were created because businesses knew that trump would be elected?
__label__1	Having our nation's economy held hostage at least twice per year is a great way to create jobs and stimulate the economy!
__label__1	Good thing we have Hillary to stand up to him
__label__-1	"""Broke the internet"" wat"
__label__-1	This includes William Henry Harrison, who managed to die a month into his first term.
__label__-1	We wont know until the insurance comes due, that is why it is an insurance file.
__label__1	But it needs more research!
__label__1	I would comment but I am just an Unpaid Non Attorney Spokesperson for the Deep State.
__label__1	That makes a fucking lot of sense.
__label__1	I'm shocked
__label__1	"The reporter who published this was abruptly fired from CNN for publishing a ""racist, bigoted"" story."
__label__-1	tacky as fuck
__label__-1	When you are angry or frustrated at someone, just hit them until they do what you want!
__label__1	Obviously, this is how Pence knew that Hillary using her private e-mail was a bad idea.
__label__1	They need to build a wall around the airports.
__label__-1	Can a POTUS write an 'immune from prosecution' letter?
__label__1	But at least we didn't elect a crooked globalist hellbent on starting WWIII with Russia!
__label__1	Well, we know they're all gonna!
__label__1	Yeah really shocking.
__label__-1	Islamic traffic accidents?
__label__1	Right, better to just pick a better school than to put time and money into making them all better... nothing bad will come of that.
__label__-1	What about the poorest cities?
__label__1	GUYS SHE'S THE MOST TRANSPARENT POLITICAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY!
__label__1	Yeah well, he gives such a compelling reason for us to like him
__label__1	What monsters!
__label__1	Great title
__label__1	Yes, way more visible too.
__label__1	There's a special place in hell for her.
__label__1	C'mon guys, this 60 year old man could have just as easily killed those people with a knife or a car.
__label__1	I'm just glad someone was brave enough to stand up and put those overprivileged transgender children in their place
__label__-1	"""Dem' gud dum furaners breed like rabbits"""
__label__1	well at least now mediocre American students can fill those slots
__label__1	Kid is cashing in on that Soros money.
__label__-1	"""Challenge accepted"" - Kanye probably"
__label__-1	I'm pretty sure he makes his wife say that so he can get off
__label__1	Problem solved.
__label__-1	This man is an asshole and he should be stripped of his job fuck you Governor.
__label__1	"If only Obama had just said ""radical Islam"" or SOMETHING, 9/11 would never have happened!"
__label__-1	Congratulations, you played yourself.
__label__-1	awww does that make everyone feel better now?
__label__1	Bristol Palin: A class act.
__label__1	Neither are the Jews, stay safe fellow fascist.
__label__1	**Department Of Homeland Security** Fake news.
__label__-1	Once again, this law will be tested and found illegal.
__label__-1	It is a tie, but all mainstream media are saying that Clinton wins because the rich people behind the mainstream media are extremely desperate and are already knowing that they will definitely lose.
__label__-1	Good!
__label__-1	umm as much as I like this story I think it violates the rules... very very old
__label__1	He's got the best people
__label__1	Well if that ain't a ringing endorsement I don't know what is.
__label__1	"It is all going to be cleared up in one week, I promise next week it, whatever the ""it"" is will be delivered and the candidate Hillary Clinton will be out."
__label__-1	"""Mr ~~Burns~~ Trump, your ~~candidacy~~ Presidency seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train, why are you so popular""?"
__label__-1	Was she ever behind in recent weeks?
__label__1	I know, like that time a real estate huckster kept saying crazy stuff about the President's birth place.
__label__-1	Thanks, Obama.
__label__-1	Trump, White House ignore demands and immediately move on to other priorities
__label__1	But it's Hillary's turn!
__label__1	Welcome to the apocalypse, people.
__label__-1	It really all Depends, on which candidate wears them.
__label__-1	Is there anything he wouldn't fuck up?
__label__1	I feel so much safer knowing this guy who fled torture to the USA and is an invested member of his community here and works extensively on humanitarian projects can't rejoin his pregnant wife and classmates.
__label__1	Just another example of crazy east coast elitism!
__label__1	But I thought statistics were lies not to be trusted anyway, right Reddit?
__label__1	Check out the sex tape!
__label__1	Because transparency is for losers.
__label__-1	Hillary made this one register to vote for Trump.
__label__-1	They are making an example out of her, but I don't think it's the example they're going for...
__label__-1	Lets be honest, there are a lot of people who abuse this program.
__label__1	He lies !
__label__-1	Well, sucks to be the people of Dupont.
__label__1	thanks obama?
__label__-1	Envy is one of the seven deadly sins.
__label__1	But Mexico is gonna pay for it!
__label__-1	"Okay, in the impossible event that I ever got a five-minute chat with this president, I would show him this article and ask, ""WTF, man?"""
__label__-1	"Because climate change implicates their own actions (or their absolute support for the free market) in harming people, while with 'muh refugees' or 'muh Mexicans"" or muh'Bama it's someone else's fault."
__label__1	What could possibly go wrong?
__label__-1	Guess who has just earned himself a place on the DHS watchlist?
__label__1	No, not coal plants but clean coal plants!
__label__-1	I think people should call Trump hotels to let them know how they feel about Trump's conflicts and a Muslim ban.
__label__1	No no no no, terrorist are brown
__label__-1	I really, really want off of this ride.
__label__1	Surely Kurt Cobain was the only person to look at an ultrasound and conclude the person in it looked like a bean.
__label__-1	Why is Betsy Devos insane other than being in a political party that you don't support?
__label__-1	There was no drugs in America before Obama.
__label__1	I'm glad he's so committed to the ideals of small government.
__label__-1	It's not like democrats have won Pennsylvania in the past 6 elections or anything.
__label__-1	Doesn't surprise me in the least.
__label__1	I personally think TV would be awesome if everyone was going on the air with no idea what was going to happen next.
__label__-1	There's a Reddit reality distortion bubble guys, sometimes we need to be mindful of being out of touch with reality.
__label__-1	I mean... he's right to try and link them.
__label__1	Really surprised at the thumbnail next to the thread title
__label__-1	Let's just be surprised that Cruz didn't walk out after being ganged up on, like he said he would in past debates.
__label__-1	FAU polls..... lol being from the area I can absolutely says this is an outlier poll
__label__-1	Is this supposed to make me want to vote for Clinton or Trump?
__label__1	Elitist.
__label__-1	The hits just keep on coming.
__label__1	That will show those internet trolls.
__label__1	Clearly they are terrorists!
__label__1	Right but while we got you here How Can You Trust Hillary Clinton After the 2008 Campaign?
__label__1	Surely, EA is worse than these people
__label__1	It's quite obvious that Ukrainians are bought out by Clinton.
__label__-1	In this thread, Trump.
__label__1	Well...they ARE outsiders...right?
__label__-1	all candidates should boycott AIPAC, and AIPAC should be registered as agents of a foreign government.
__label__1	she would be in girl prison and everyone knows girls can't rape
__label__-1	Michael D. McCurry, Co-chairman of The Commission on Presidential Debates was Bill Clinton's press secretary.
__label__1	Because unions will totally go for someone who claims American wages are too high
__label__1	Amazing what happens when you force people to buy overpriced healthcare with non-negotiable prices!
__label__-1	Not to mention tourist visas, which are the source of most illegal immigrants in the US.
__label__-1	What I don't understand is this: if the Feds can command insurers to pay for [fill in your desired thing]... ....why can't, *or why won't*, the Feds simply tell insurers they must pay for **everything** related to all medical issues?
__label__1	Those women and children should buy some guns to protect themselves.
__label__1	Yeah, classy... Let's make this guy president.
__label__1	Can't let pesky details like that get in the way of city-wide mass deportations can't we ?
__label__-1	So are Trump supporters going to crucify her for not believing his accusers like they do with Hillary for siding with Bill?
__label__-1	Shep, you are a bright spot in a cesspool.
__label__1	They probably just did it to impress all us handsome young Bernie Bros.
__label__-1	I don't know if all boy scouts are gays, they could probably tie the knot like fifty different ways.
__label__1	But FAKE NEWS
__label__-1	**Washington Post Reports on Monster that the Left Created** Fixed that headline
__label__-1	because cheap labour prints money
__label__-1	It just so happens to be *the* issue (money, bribery, corruption) that overarches every other issue.
__label__1	She's fired up her after-berners
__label__-1	Totally not voting for him now.
__label__-1	Is that like the only bank that he knows about?
__label__-1	Willingness is not an expression of desire.
__label__1	pure class
__label__-1	Okay let's take a step back then - does he know what a trade deal is?
__label__1	maybe if we get 45,000 signatures on a petition, we can make it happen.
__label__1	Sooo you're saying there's a chance?
__label__-1	Talk to the people in California smoking medical marijuana; most of them are happy and have no interest in moving to harder drugs
__label__-1	Maybe putting the Reality TV Star who can't keep his racist pie-hole shut in charge wasn't such a good idea, GOP.
__label__-1	Heroin is expensive.
__label__1	Yeah, the media sure is ignoring her email scandal
__label__1	Glad to hear that there will be no more crime in CT.
__label__-1	Democrats use cheat sheets, Trump supporters use white sheets.
__label__1	Ebola is God's punishment on Texas for giving Human Rights to Mexicans and Wimmen.... wait... that's not right
__label__1	REDDIT IS AN ATHEIST CIRCLE JERK BLAH BLAH BLAH MY OPINION JUSTIFYING BELIEF IN A MYTH IS NEW AND INTERESTING
__label__-1	Of course they do.
__label__-1	Every thumbnail of this fucks face is more punchable than the last.
__label__-1	Louis the 16th was smarter than King.
__label__-1	I don't understand how anybody can support Clinton still.
__label__-1	"The fuck is an ""assault weapon""?"
__label__-1	My party has a lot of wankers.
__label__1	Gotta stick to his principals even if it means the people suffer.
__label__1	Nice to know the prosecution didn't make it a clear cut case of someone following a suspicious person and then killing them in self defense.
__label__-1	Why would God want you to start breaking the eighth and tenth commandments?
__label__1	To be fair Sessions and the GOP members on the panel were also wearing KKK robes, so maybe they were just trying to fit in.
__label__-1	Very happy sleepy doctor will be part of the administration.
__label__-1	Ethics... Who gives a fuck.
__label__-1	Trump has his goon squad already warming up.
__label__1	Lying isn't a sin if you're lying to those outside the covenant.
__label__-1	Blatant lies are all they have left.
__label__1	Clearly we need to add more laws we won't enforce because the current laws which we don't enforce aren't sufficient.
__label__1	I just need more data, I can't decide if I approve or disapprove of the job he's doing.
__label__1	Trump has a lot of leverage given the 43% unemployment rate.
__label__-1	I guess Rubio paid the voting machine owners and Drumpf didn't
__label__-1	And that's in six months.
__label__1	Yeah, Hillary was much worse on protecting classified info
__label__-1	As someone in healthcare business this is a direct violation to the patient's rights to know about their health.
__label__1	Yeah that stammering sure was annoying.
__label__-1	Millionaire's what?
__label__-1	Schmaschmortion
__label__1	That's the liberal media for you.
__label__-1	A question for you gun nuts: do you *ever* get tired of living your lives as abject cowards?
__label__-1	I think America should be nominated for the Darwin Award this year.
__label__-1	lol
__label__-1	Unless she's a native american she needs to commit suicide, since she's an immigrant as well.
__label__1	Hey you can't use his own words against him!
__label__-1	One would almost say unpresidented.
__label__-1	BSMSNBC
__label__1	Oh well then.
__label__1	Surely these optics will help with his dwindling AA vote share
__label__1	ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD LIMIT A JOB BY GENDER ROLES YOU SHITLORD.
__label__1	I know my personal wealth almost doubled in the last 5 years.
__label__1	250 latinas in Miami; that's a large number.
__label__1	"She never once tried to make ""alternative facts""a thing, those were just a liberal lie."
__label__1	No this is the first we are hearing of it.
__label__-1	He's waiting so he can appoint them as federal judges.
__label__-1	I sometimes get the Conservative Republicans confused with the Saudi Arabia government
__label__1	"""an isolated incident"", ""not all cops are like this"", ""a few bad apples"", ""if she'd followed the law she wouldn't have had this problem"", ""he was just doing his job"""
__label__1	What a compelling and graceful argument.
__label__1	But both sides are the same amirite
__label__1	Only the civil liberties I care about are important!
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__1	What, you don't like your money supply tied to something someone digs out of the ground?
__label__1	They would never think to look there
__label__1	Well this seems like it has a good chance of passing, isn't populist fodder with unintended consequences, and exactly what I like to see from serious candidates.
__label__-1	But what does Ja Rule think?
__label__1	Hillary's so out of touch, her bathrooms have closets!
__label__-1	Hey thanks for doing this leg work!
__label__-1	Are blogs allowed or not?
__label__-1	That's what turned me libertarian.
__label__-1	So this guy thinks the federal reserve should be stored in Trump tower or that ~~hourly employees~~ low wage citizens should be paid in Trump Bucks?
__label__1	Totally dumb, he should only agree to do this if Obama shows his dental records to prove he's not an alien, or something.
__label__-1	Then do we need gun laws, or do we really need some breeding restrictions?
__label__1	Remember, Republicans and Democrats are the same.
__label__-1	True but Dems have lacked the balls to call them on it
__label__1	I know aren't risotto recipes and campaigns planning for the future not bigger stories than a candidate's supporters making people so afraid they are fleeing the country!
__label__1	That's why he got congressional approval for Libya.
__label__-1	What a coincidence
__label__1	He only hires the best.
__label__-1	FYI the market fell downn
__label__-1	Ugh who voted for these clown.
__label__1	His history of corporate bankruptcies shows that he's not to be trusted with credit.
__label__-1	Ron Paul/Paula Dean 2016
__label__1	Brilliant !
__label__1	relax none of us can be racist for like a month, we all have a black president.
__label__1	Yeah I mean if people don't like what a party is about you'd think they'd leave or something and go to one that aligns with their views better.
__label__1	I'm shocked
__label__1	Ohh there's my African American
__label__1	I'm sure they were just talking about tea and crumpets, right.
__label__-1	You should really pick a third party that you're interested in instead, I believe that if any of them gets 15% they get public funding and get to participate in future presidential debates
__label__1	I hope he repeals ACA before eliminating vaccines; would be a shame if we had a preventable disease outbreak *before* stripping tens of millions of people of health insurance.
__label__-1	Classify Science as a foreign language, Pass legislation requiring only english language documents will be considered by Congress.
__label__-1	Wow, USA is turing into Africa
__label__1	I think it's awesome that there are berniebros who say they will vote for Trump if Bernie loses the primary.
__label__1	I wonder, now that it's become clear what the shooter's motives were, when Cruz will condemn this act of Christian terrorism.
__label__-1	There is a new word for that, Anti-Clinton.
__label__-1	What difference does it make?
__label__-1	If I did my job that poorly I'd be homeless.
__label__1	This article is a Nazi.
__label__1	"Yes, time for the ""in one week,"" they will indict Hillary post."
__label__1	It's spelled unpresidented you dumb lib
__label__-1	Does it have teeth?
__label__-1	This is by far the funniest thing I've read in a while and I had to share it.
__label__1	Finally a serious crime she can be arrested over.
__label__1	Oh she will really burnish the TeaRepublican image.
__label__-1	It's funny because all Americans are fat, coke-drinking, gun owning slobs, you see.
__label__1	Cause Goldman Sachs is the people's bank, right?
__label__-1	"this is called a ""false flag"""
__label__1	"I wonder if Russia was the ""brain condition"" that Glenn Beck got rid of."
__label__-1	There he goes again.
__label__1	no, no the war in iraq was not about oil!
__label__-1	The GOP reminds me of Enron except that Trump is only a cartoon backwoods character too dumb to understand any of it still imagining he is the smartest guy in the room the day before the end comes and trying to sell his stock to fools.
__label__1	I wonder what kind of bias the author has.
__label__-1	Now he only needs to get about 60 million more people to vote for him and he wins!
__label__-1	Crooked Betsy!
__label__1	That doesn't sound shady at all.
__label__-1	It's unfortunate that there are only these three sources of journalism in Western media.
__label__-1	I remember Obama supporting ISIS in Syria.
__label__-1	/R/TimCanova up and down, people.
__label__1	See, Both parties are the same
__label__1	Enjoy your down votes, terrorist!
__label__1	but Bill isn't running for President!
__label__-1	Who?
__label__-1	And then orders another, bigger, airstrike.
__label__1	If only those Democrats weren't so freaking un-American.
__label__1	Yeah, because the Democratic Party is such a bastion of intellectualism.
__label__-1	She said she wanted to impose a no-fly zone on Syria, how do you not see how that would result in a war like it did in Libya?
__label__1	Well, Baghdad Rush has said it so we can stop all investigations now!
__label__-1	I'm not even surprised by the thuggery anymore.
__label__-1	Starting at 8 years old, of course
__label__1	How do they not understand that religious freedom is for Christians only?
__label__-1	That was a really good overview of the Chinese meeting the weekend.
__label__-1	That's like saying, I would of had a lot more money if I didn't blow my life savings in a casino.
__label__1	Yeah, he would have had to look Chelsea in the eye *then*.
__label__-1	Donnie will be surprised to learn that his fan boys do not appreciate his carefully contrived stunt to look tough on another nation.
__label__-1	Are you calling me a 'twat'?
__label__-1	How is this relevant?
__label__-1	Why isn't it a majority rule vote?
__label__-1	I don't think you can even argue mistake here, they were indifferent to whether the suspect was in the vehicle or not.
__label__-1	I'm so glad my TOPS already paid out for this semester and hopefully Edwards can fix enough of this for me to get TOPS next semester.
__label__1	Yes we can!
__label__-1	The amount I pay for health insurance is the same as it was 10 years ago.
__label__1	Actually you cant prove she intended to be Secretary of State
__label__-1	He's been given plenty of time, so no.
__label__1	See they just want to ruin it for everyone!
__label__1	BUT THEY WANT TO KILL US ALL, OBUMMER!
__label__-1	How much of that was illegally laundered?
__label__-1	Cancel the wall?
__label__-1	"If the stenographers in our ""newsrooms"" could stop publishing the Assange is a rapist hit pieces and actually do their jobs we wouldn't need wikileaks... Of course, they're too well paid to even think of rocking the boat."
__label__1	It's his way of continuing to show everyone who calls the shots.
__label__1	I'm sure the Commish doesn't get a dime directly or indirectly from comcast.
__label__-1	Whenever I hear of things like this it makes me wonder what is the root cause of a police officers committing domestic violence, or of any person committing domestic violence.
__label__1	Deport him!
__label__-1	"Tag required: ""tabloid"""
__label__-1	The future of Europe...:(
__label__-1	Breitbart, as expected, using the rape of a 14 year old girl to make a political point and whip up hate against an entire group of people.
__label__-1	I don't understand how people would expect another outcome.
__label__-1	That actually sounds plausible, especially since Access Hollywood is an NBC property.
__label__-1	Will those birds ever cease with their constant chattering and singing?
__label__-1	"""They're trying to build a prison... for you and me"" -Serj Tankian"
__label__1	That sounds fair.
__label__1	Don't bother with a citation
__label__-1	Romney was running against the first black president This isn't very surprising
__label__-1	They might as well just start shooting at protestors from the rooftops, for all the attention they pay to the law.
__label__1	Just imagine the support he could have had if he had showed up orange in a sombrero!
__label__1	But democrats are the war mongers !

__label__1	Oh good.
__label__-1	I guess we know that Trump met with Paul Ryan today.
__label__-1	Kiss any GOP nomination goodbye cuz that's tantamount to spitting on Reagan's grave.
__label__1	nope, its the gays.....
__label__1	"No they should be forced to watch, ""Clockwork Orange"" style."
__label__1	Oh come on guys, he was just kidding!
__label__1	I can't see how this will be abused.
__label__1	Those damn democrats and their obstructionist policies.
__label__1	Who on earth would guild this article
__label__-1	Trump will finally be able to speak his mind, and call Hillary a C and Obama an N. That will turn this election around!
__label__-1	"I love when the poll came out showing women under 30 supporting Bernie in the 80s %, and dudes were tweeting ""I'm with Bernie because that's where the girls are!"""
__label__1	At least 0.01% are brave enough to stand up and tell the truth about climate change, even if the other 99.99% are cowards.
__label__1	Companies = Evil Taking away their ability to be People = Taking away their power Therefore this is great, without even knowing what the amendment stands for, because the other two suppositions are obviously true.
__label__1	Because conservatives are always the victims.

__label__-1	I have yet to meet an open-carrier outside the woods in brown bear country (and that's a mixed bag of guns-as-ego-support too) who isn't a fucking pathetic asshole.
__label__-1	Well, he's their kinda guy: mean spirited, petty, and bullying.
__label__-1	Perhaps Trump should change Mar-a-Lago from french to whatever it is in Mexican.
__label__-1	TIL somebody still gives a shit about Glenn Beck.

__label__1	Them deport them instead.
__label__1	Worked for Polio!

__label__1	So he's always happy?
__label__-1	Remember all the Trump supporters screaming that Trump was pro-lbgt and that he would be the better choice for the gay community because Hillary once said she believed in traditional marriage like a decade+ ago?
__label__1	Thank you mother russia for your completely sincere interest in our completely rigged election process.
__label__1	Great endorsement!

__label__-1	Because pro-life Trumps all
__label__-1	Damn it U of M. Come on guys, this is literally the embodiment of separate but equal, which is never a good thing.
__label__1	Say what you want about Trump, but he's united us all in how we see our world standing
__label__-1	No one shames sluts more than other women.
__label__1	Because Trump didn't try to do that with Obama and the birth certificate issue.
__label__1	Eh, who cares about the cannon fodder, its the war profiteers who really matter
__label__-1	Has anyone seen her birth certificate yet?
__label__-1	This is a problem if you can't make your way into the 1%.

__label__1	Doesn't matter, he's already rich.
__label__-1	We just lost the moral high ground to China, I will never forgive the people who voted for Trump for this.
__label__1	Oh, and I'm sure he'll leave the gun-owners alone, because a well armed populace is exactly what a dictator wants.
__label__1	shocker!
__label__-1	Well gun owners don't pay the costs of what their gun ownership costs the rest of us in the medical realm, why would they be held accountable for their actions in the criminal realm?
__label__1	Caucuses can't be undemocratic, they mostly helped Bernie
__label__1	Because that's how you MAGA.
__label__1	That's sexist
__label__1	They'll all just be acts of God, proof that He is punishing us for electing a Kenyan Muslim as President!
__label__-1	This restaurant will be closed within 6 months.
__label__1	This is all because Trump is running for president IIRC
__label__1	whether you like him or not, at least he's honest
__label__1	Obviously, he MUST be a Democrat!
__label__1	That will give Romney some legitimacy.
__label__-1	Seriously, fuck Title IX
__label__1	Yes, having significantly more them half of voters against the president should be a meaningless fact.
__label__-1	I mean, people still have to vote for these candidates.
__label__-1	Now they're just trolling.
__label__-1	ugh why cant this guy just crawl back to Vermont, watch Matlock and go away
__label__1	Will you just guaranteed your spot in hell!
__label__-1	I don't understand how someone could not try at least once to get in contact with family left behind
__label__1	You cannot expect the first half-white president to accomplish such a daunting task, only full-white bureaucrats can summon the power to stand up against the smear campaigns of Big Pharma and Big Tobacco who will try to slander and stop them.
__label__-1	Draft dodger criticizes people who did not dodge the draft for their service to their country.
__label__1	Haha take that liberals!

__label__-1	Most likely because humans come out as infants
__label__-1	BLM and Dallas PD have respect for each other, this sniper is a moron.
__label__1	I hope they don't investigate themselves too hard!
__label__1	But Hillary had some meetings with some of the Clinton Foundation donors, so they're both the same!
__label__-1	"Making someone an ""honorary"" anything is the same thing as telling them not to show up ever again."
__label__1	Come on guys, we all know Romney won but Obama stole the election through his devious Muslim ways
__label__1	I'm totally surprised...
__label__-1	"Could have stopped the title at ""Hillary Clinton still out of Touch""."
__label__-1	He sure has been effective for the last 30 years.
__label__-1	It's not the they wouldn't research, it's that they believe everything reported outside their batshit crazy right wing media bubble is straight up false.
__label__-1	"Why do I feel like I am at the beginning of ""In the Garden of Beasts"" more and more every day?"
__label__-1	Would it matter?

__label__-1	It's over, pack up and go home
__label__-1	Trump supporters are now resorting to literal shitposts
__label__-1	Proof that Trump is in the pocket of the S&amp;M industry.
__label__-1	Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) tweeted that the vote was in violation of committee rules so is not valid.
__label__1	It's good that they mentioned it's a soccer mom, it just goes to show that the police are way off base
__label__-1	make america last again!
__label__-1	Maybe some press conferences would be a healthy break
__label__-1	He just has to drag it out does he?
__label__-1	Confirmed: Nameless blog pushes worthless headline
__label__1	Cuz the top 1% doesn't have enough billions already.
__label__-1	The vetting was considerably less extreme.
__label__-1	... real satisfaction!
__label__1	Why the President must be insane, no one is safe until every one over the age of 5 is armed and loaded.
__label__-1	Or, you know, human whistles
__label__-1	Unfortunately this will do little to tarnish Hillary's approval right now amidst the befuddlement of the Donald with his remarks from yesterday.
__label__1	And that's why you need the death penalty.
__label__1	I thought she told that cabal of corporate lobbyists trying to secretly write global trade rules in favor of a narrow set of intellectual property and banking interests to cut it out.
__label__1	Yeah nobody really thought Trump was this bad except Kasich
__label__1	great, freedom of religion just went down the tubes.
__label__1	Drill, baby, drill.
__label__-1	...which would mean a *lot* in a country with a different political system than the US'
__label__-1	I'm surprised they know, since they haven't passed a budget in years.
__label__1	I feel safer already
__label__-1	Meanwhile in realityland - early voting astoundingly popular and effective for polling, though long lines mean more locations are required.
__label__1	Uh oh, ethics committee is going to overstep their bounds again.
__label__1	Did someone explain to M Brownshirt what FEMA stands for and what they are supposed to do yet?
__label__1	This isn't about Bernie Sanders why did you even post it?
__label__1	And just like his dad and brother he will save us from peace and prosperity.
__label__-1	Remember, Trump isn't an 'alpha male'; he's what non-alpha males think an alpha male is.
__label__1	But it's important to increase the record profits of the wealthy so that they can make more jobs!
__label__1	Racial divisions, always a great strategy
__label__1	and this is the exact reason why we should have a smaller federal government and larger state governments
__label__-1	Texas style LIBERTY!
__label__1	That'll totally convince those White Supremacist, like David Duke, to not vote for you anymore.
__label__-1	He's not as good as Colbert.
__label__-1	the only one that needs to apologize is Hillary.
__label__1	"*""You would have had a health insurance, if you hadn't bought an IPhone""*"

__label__1	Shame you can't buy stocks with food stamps.
__label__-1	These are required criteria?
__label__1	But but he wasn't President then, guys!
__label__-1	"""Even if the US only ends up with one ally, that ally will be Israel."""

__label__1	Because profits being at an all time-high is a myth.
__label__1	I thought Republicans like states rights.
__label__1	True presidential temperament
__label__1	Ohhhhhhhh scary scary, quick hide under your bed and tape your windows.
__label__-1	number one use for a gun at home... suicide, murder is second.

__label__1	But... but crowd sizes, shit polls, ashamed voters and podesta emails.
__label__1	Because there's only one culture?
__label__1	This was a rigged poll!
__label__1	So it didn't work the last two times, must be because it was too small.
__label__-1	Yes, let's pray the fraudster rapist get there first and we will all be saved.
__label__-1	rekt
__label__-1	whatadick
__label__1	2nd amendment patriots, am I right?
__label__-1	Reporters should hang a picture of the crowd from the back to counter.
__label__1	They were great at that in WWII
__label__1	Well she is a women so that makes it okay.
__label__-1	Like every administration ever?
__label__-1	"i like to think that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it and now theyre like ""well fuck now they think we did it..."""
__label__1	"""I hire the best guys"""
__label__-1	Tell me his running mate is Costello
__label__-1	But what about Ken Bone tho
__label__1	What a leader
__label__-1	Republicans will reach out alright, with the back of a hand.
__label__-1	39% is pretty damn high, america.
__label__1	But sjw's and BS supporters have said that is racist.
__label__-1	He's complaining about constituents reaching out to their elected representatives?
__label__-1	Same thing.
__label__-1	that's not very fair to byproducts of anal sex
__label__-1	Ya think?
__label__-1	More went to the tax rallies then went to trump's innaguration
__label__1	How dare the queen have any pressure on her.
__label__-1	I wouldn't have Sarah Palin teaching math any more than I would have Michele Bachmann teaching American history.
__label__1	Shocking
__label__1	What could possibly go wrong in having a profit incentive to locking people up?
__label__-1	This could very well be the one thing he's been right about.
__label__-1	Of all the possible ethics violations this administration could commit, this is the least of them
__label__1	Can we stop bashing the job-creators here?
__label__1	They forgot to mention that it would be 30 feet below ground so you can't dig underneath it
__label__1	What a man of the people
__label__-1	Probably easier to count cabinet members that have NOT made false statements ... just saying
__label__-1	ITT: People continuing to deny Trump is racist and emboldens a lot of racists, and a lot of people valiantly demonstrating otherwise only to be ignored.

__label__1	Canadians should be extremely vetted!
__label__1	I'm sure it's just all a big coincidence
__label__-1	This election proves that we are not politically correct enough.
__label__-1	Liar.
__label__1	But remember guys, both parties are exactly the same!
__label__-1	So trump?
__label__1	At least they're *female* workers.
__label__1	Hooray for beauracracy!
__label__-1	I'll bet he's done nothing illegal, it just boils down to ethics and what the heck does that have to do with anything?
__label__-1	Republicans: Oppose all three.

__label__-1	Breitbart;DR
__label__1	What a maverick
__label__-1	Watching the GOP implode, knowing it is personally responsible for this clusterfuck, is absolutely delicious.
__label__-1	It's also majorly unconstitutional.
__label__1	This isn't news because the mainstream media isn't reporting it.
__label__1	But he is in no way acting as an arbiter at all, interfering, or selectively releasing information for political purpose, no way.
__label__1	The system works!
__label__-1	Did you watch the GOP debate that's what you call interruption that's what you call disrespect...these ppl are full of shit
__label__-1	could any millionaires out there tell me why you would need an extra 10k off the backs of poor people?

__label__-1	me too and shamefully i am a registered republican .. that will be voting again for obama !
__label__1	WV Dems are obviously sexist
__label__1	I'm sure that Flynn simply pardoned himself because he wasn't capable of being part of an administration winning so much on a daily basis.
__label__-1	One can only hope
__label__1	But I'm pretty sure Obama was the anti-Christ....
__label__-1	Good thing we have those bright guys at the CIA to keep up with this for our idiot soon to be president.
__label__1	But why own a gun if you can't even use it to make people fear you?
__label__-1	Can you imagine the uproar if Obama had said this?
__label__-1	...aaaand, how'd that work out for you, Steve-o?
__label__-1	"If there is anything reddit hates more than these right wing assclowns that use PETA as a strawman to represent all ""liberals"", its PETA itself."
__label__1	That's ok, these children still have their second amendment right to defend themselves.
__label__1	Earth-shattering.
__label__1	Wow I can't imagine why Christie and Giuliani would want to push for an investigation that could potentially hurt Clinton
__label__1	*for freedom*
__label__1	*I need to become crowned king QUICK before the dementia totally overtakes me and I won't even be able to appreciate it anymore*
__label__-1	Uh, yeah?
__label__-1	This is the best answer.
__label__1	Our great negotiator doesn't need something trivial like information.
__label__-1	Someone in HR should be getting fired.
__label__1	Why do you want to punish success?
__label__-1	When will politicians start talking/realizing about automation being a factor in the loss of jobs
__label__-1	it's more that they don't have lobbyists.
__label__1	Look at all these horrible bigoted racist Trump Supporters!
__label__-1	Glorious news.
__label__1	Walmart may pay their employees in pennies in order to force them to open a Walmart bank account.
__label__1	That just proves its a hoax!
__label__-1	At least 8, because that's how long it took to make it.
__label__1	CNN telling you what to do and think... definitely not fake news
__label__1	Because we all know destroying old mobile devices erases emails.
__label__1	Yeah, but that doesn't account for the -20 point Obama nomination hit that any candidate has to overcome first.
__label__1	Holy shit, I never expected this.
__label__1	Another Republican party hero!
__label__1	Helps Us Bernie Wan Sandori!
__label__1	in light of this hack, I am still convinced that HRC's Microsoft Exchange Email Server, stored in her bathroom closet remain secure.
__label__1	But Trump is going to win in NY!
__label__1	Yeah, but those folks work for their government paycheck!
__label__-1	That fine isnt going to make Koch give a fuck about clean air or the environment, I heard his private jet runs on sliced dolphin.

__label__-1	Can't wait for the Teflon Don to declare a trade war with China in 140 characters or less..
__label__1	That makes him smart.
__label__1	and Hillary, and Soros, and Bill, and Podesta
__label__-1	Those hackers at wikipedia are always up to no good.
__label__1	Nothing ends something faster than declaring a war on it...
__label__1	I don't see the big deal; lots of people who were born before this election cycle are voting.
__label__-1	Why is it always a call to abolish a government entity instead of radically reforming it?
__label__-1	Bush had you down?
__label__1	Trumpcare is going to the the greatest!
__label__-1	Can't wait until the next Correspondent's Dinner.

__label__-1	It is a hack so it must be news!
__label__1	What a down to Earth guy we can all relate to
__label__1	Well Nader did help us get eight years of W. So he has a great record to boast of.
__label__1	Republicans ain't crazy at all
__label__1	Looks like Alex has sold out to the (((globalists))), am I right?
__label__1	TIL 74% of Americans are reporters.
__label__1	Ethics are overrated anyway, the whole point of holding office is to enrich yourself and your CEO freinds.
__label__-1	Imagine the backroom pressure he is exerting to get a knighthood.
__label__-1	"Ironic how the purported ""Constitution Party"" has very little respect for the Constitution."
__label__1	It's because they aren't conservative enough
__label__1	But at least they're not liberals!
__label__1	Obviously molestation is a critical part of keeping this great and mighty country safe from all those dirty Muslims I mean terrorists
__label__1	Because Bernie supporters are sexist too, right?
__label__1	There are already too many Cubans running for pres.
__label__1	I thought we didn't want Russians meddling in our elections?
__label__-1	That man can really pull of a beard.
__label__-1	Yes, but Hillary won majority of the voters in NY.
__label__1	That sounds just.
__label__-1	They only thank the soldiers that they can use for political gain.
__label__-1	u mad?
__label__1	Oh boy, maybe she'll get indicted!
__label__1	Early mornings like this....Trump's meds haven't kicked in yet.
__label__-1	Liberals are happy they ended michigan recount because double counted ballots in hillary clinton counties would show she would have lost thousands of votes.
__label__1	**failing NY Times
__label__1	Well all blacks live in the inner city soooo....
__label__1	That right does not apply to fags.
__label__-1	"Don't want to ruin that ""American Carnage"" narrative by actually trying to help people's suffering."
__label__1	BUT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP
__label__-1	I'm sure the FSB and KGB are just righteous, and morally sound organizations, not full of killers and ran by a killer at all.
__label__1	In other news, lobbyist and politicians feel really ashamed when they have millions in their bank accounts.
__label__-1	Maybe it's that he's not white enough?
__label__-1	Maybe this world just needs to end :(
__label__1	Oh boy, I sure hope all of the people who spend their life work trashing Tulsi Gabbard get in here and denigrate the names of these traitors who clearly have a Russian pro-Assad conspiracy they're involved in.
__label__-1	No shit.
__label__1	Drone them based on cellphone usage patterns!
__label__1	Makes sense, we have solved all of our problems in America.
__label__-1	DeBeers hoards diamonds to keep the price up,
__label__1	No bias in this comment
__label__1	"""with no one officer being suspended for more than 10 days"" Makes sense, it was only an average of 2 shots per officer"
__label__1	I wonder if she will address Powell's emails.
__label__1	But when guys in white sheets do it, it's a party
__label__1	But, it's Obama's fault!

__label__-1	Rash B No Stahp Cyka Blyat
__label__-1	it's almost as if the immigration policy is supposed to benefit the host country and its citizens first, not the immigrants
__label__1	But he doesn't settle
__label__-1	Democrats are on the fast track to losing 2020 and Huffington Post is leading the charge with their rhetoric.
__label__-1	If Trump and his cronies have their way, the national debt will most likely balloon.
__label__1	Not unless Bernie is gonna win!
__label__1	But Hillary is the sick one!
__label__-1	So weak, so sad.
__label__-1	The ATF should be abolished!
__label__-1	He knows a compliant republican when he buys one.
__label__-1	This is even worse than when Mitt Romney tried to look Hispanic with his orange makeup
__label__1	I'm sure the trump team can devise a new chant that will inspire millions of seniors to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
__label__1	Ooh ooh don't forget the choice to die or live in terror that's the best one!
__label__-1	As much as the guy is a piece of garbage, rotten tomatoes make for longer entertainment, as death by being pelted with rotten tomatoes takes longer than death by being pelted with bricks.
__label__-1	Because the leaks are boring af?
__label__-1	Aw hell, just about anywhere in Alabama yawl can find White guys who'll do that fer free.
__label__-1	I'm really optimistic that this kind of thing will continue under Trump's presidency
__label__-1	What a hero
__label__-1	"You forgot ""Russian Ally and Propagandist""."
__label__-1	*Hillary confused shrug face*
__label__1	Have you met our Lord and Savior George Soros?
__label__1	You don't say
__label__1	I'm so shocked
__label__1	They should just re-release Reefer Madness

__label__1	Nonsense, they were simply discussing Bill's nice round of golf in the current pleasant 100+ degree Phoenix weather.
__label__1	Illegal immigrants are not allowed to vote anyways.
__label__1	Oh gosh, I wonder if the movie will be able to make a profit now.
__label__-1	More true than false.
__label__-1	And the regressive alt right couldn't care less, they want a billionaire elitist criminal in the WH.
__label__1	Solution: work at a temp agency.
__label__-1	Donald was right
__label__-1	All roar no bite, at least where it counts, at the voting booth.
__label__1	I'm sure he's going to be 100% honest once he gets into office though.
__label__1	I'm sure he'll take that well and respond reasonably.
__label__-1	Then maybe the cartels should stop being a one trick pony and move into banking and the stock market where the rest of the criminals are.
__label__1	Bold leadership.
__label__1	No shit dumbass that's how you win debates.
__label__1	What about TrumpEd, a new national K-12 charter education startup run for profit ... because only the private sector knows how to run things, right?
__label__-1	The caveat is this data mostly came from Dem offices because Republican Members are would rather withhold their own numbers from the public and their constituents than be transparent about the opposition to the bill in their own districts.
__label__1	Both parties are the same.
__label__-1	Except offcourse our very honorable comrades from the_toiletbowl
__label__-1	The waiter went straight home and posted on t_d.
__label__1	"""I just really wanna fuck shit up in 2020, too"" said Stein"
__label__1	Good thing that is going to be paid for by cuts elsewhere.
__label__1	While we're at it, let's also teach men not to rape, educate the world how only white people can be racist, arrest all members of the patriarchy, and create federal safe spaces for women and otherkin.
__label__-1	What a shitpost.
__label__-1	I used to dream of being and doing many things in my life, but it's all been reduced to just one thing lately...move to Cali Cali.
__label__-1	REALLY interested to see what happens to the country after the next presidency.. I wouldn't be half surprised if no matter who is elected.. the country is fractured irreparably.
__label__-1	Doesn't he also consume the blood of young people for anti-aging purposes?
__label__-1	Well even broken, dumbass clocks are correct twice a day.
__label__1	That'll make things better.
__label__-1	Maybe because he realized he actually has to follow through now.
__label__1	Wow I bet this article is completely factual and contains no personal opinion at all!
__label__-1	Crime fell at the same rate in other cities without stop and frisk.

__label__-1	If only we had more guns...we could be like the middle east, or Pakistan.
__label__-1	Remember, any money taken/used is above the allotted $104 per day any legislator gets.
__label__1	As if receiving $153 million from special interests would have any impact on your decisions.
__label__-1	those groups of people should just band together online and dedicate some of their pay to a large communal pool, such that they can use the money to establish a business together in the line of work they majored in.
__label__-1	If you extend that to the first family it's more than once a day.
__label__-1	Gotta love how all the hillbots are ignoring that this is proof of Hillary breaking the law
__label__-1	let our downvotes begin
__label__-1	That would be nice and all if Obama had actually been accepting Christian refugees.
__label__1	Oh, that'll help
__label__-1	no brakes on this train
__label__-1	Bullies
__label__-1	Clearly making this up for the fame.
__label__1	Down vote - this is a sexist article
__label__-1	You have to be a special kind of stupid to believe the government creates jobs.
__label__-1	I have a vision of people from Arizona having to dig tunnels under certain states to get anywhere else.
__label__-1	They are giving a child poison candy.
__label__1	And if Trump builds that wall they will be stuck here.
__label__1	If there's one opinion I trust about the inner workings of left wing politics it's the true Bolsheviks like Heat St
__label__-1	With some luck he won't part of the group that opposes it
__label__1	If you think this is something, wait till I tell you about the EMAILS.
__label__1	Hey black people, why haven't you accomplished as much as white people in America... Sure you had your businesses and churches and towns burned down, and your people lynched without committing any crimes, and you were barred from college for about 200 years, but c'mon.
__label__-1	yup, we elected him to solve all the problems and instead he keeps blaming everyone else for things he inherited.
__label__1	Oh wow whatever shall we do!
__label__-1	The tea party types would give him the electric chair.
__label__-1	"""common sense"" Every time I hear someone use this phrase as an actual, integral part of an argument, I assume they're an idiot and their argument isn't sound."
__label__-1	The rats are fleeing the ship.
__label__1	Yeah, I imagine DARPAnet was awash in buzz over the watergate mess.
__label__-1	fucking teacher's union, they can burn in hell
__label__-1	When I grow up, I want to have a union job with the State, so i can make people pay me more and have retirement benefits greater than my salary.
__label__-1	Considering it is rump that ordered his people to start this, that is asinine.
__label__1	Yeah the DNC picked a horrible candidate.
__label__-1	Good, as an economic refugee from California I can tell you that it is fucking expensive out there.
__label__1	I suppose between morning (when he tweeted about the drone) and now Trump got a note from Bank of China about higher mortgage payments.
__label__1	Yeah, no hidden agenda behind THIS action.
__label__1	WE DID IT REDDIT!
__label__-1	Next up: federal law bans people who have had detention from owning guns
__label__-1	"Can someone find that ""random"" guys twitter and see if hes a delirious nut job?"
__label__-1	The science is clear about sugar, but it does not advocate a specific policy like this tax.
__label__1	at least we know they are making good use of their time
__label__-1	Because they and their families want to eat, and there are those who see nothing wrong with exploiting desperate people for profits.
__label__-1	But Trump was a champion of the working class?
__label__1	He's secretly a Lutheran!
__label__-1	Obama liberals : we should invade Russia and Syria Trump liberals : I can't believe we would get involved, gassing his own people is fine
__label__1	Yes, clearly Brexit was a fantastic idea.
__label__-1	This is a double palm through the face.
__label__-1	Humanity...still not even close to crawling out of the Dark Age.
__label__-1	your move catholics
__label__-1	Imagine what we would know about Hillary if the media actually was interested in investigating her like they do Trump.
__label__1	perhaps if they turned the executions into televised pay-per-view events, they could recoup some of their expenditures.
__label__-1	I thought the economy was awesome because Obama saved it
__label__-1	I am absolutely shocked this is on fox.
__label__-1	that's not really going to help him much in the primary, because so will trump and every other candidate in the race.
__label__1	The party of personal responsibility strikes again.
__label__-1	So good America denied the 'corrupt' Hillary for this.
__label__-1	Basically, no actual proof.
__label__1	This is why Colorado has become a burning hellscape of violence.....
__label__-1	I wonder if it's related to the fact that people actually had to sign up for something by now.
__label__1	Well, there is just so little crime in NYC that they can do this.
__label__-1	Corporate feudalism is what I call it.
__label__1	Sanders, just another paid Hillary shill.
__label__-1	Who are quite conservative.
__label__1	Don't worry people, he has Scott Walker's approval!
__label__-1	This aide is the one behind the twitter leaks, they just did it to keep their cover.
__label__-1	I think this is just what the big 3 news (cbs, abc, NBC) used to be 20+ years ago.
__label__-1	Russia is Trumps America.
__label__1	dude, that was ART...
__label__1	No point of being Politically Correct in Trump alt-reality!
__label__-1	All those part time jobs under 29 hrs a week created to avoid Obamacare for businesses will vanish.
__label__-1	Yes that is how voting works
__label__1	No shit - it's probably just liberal propaganda data though
__label__-1	How is this not whataboutism?
__label__-1	It's gonna be a great 8 years
__label__-1	Fox News and their endless mission to make the middles hate the poors, but please pay no attention to the rich behind the curtain.
__label__-1	I bet he just has dirt on all of them and they are cowards.
__label__-1	Doesn't she already have enough?
__label__-1	Fox News has a conservative bias, and often editorializes well beyond any reasonable interpretation of the facts at hand.
__label__1	But if we set up needle exchanges that'll just encourage it!
__label__-1	As a Wisconsinite I can tell you that would be very bad.
__label__1	Would be a shame if a 2nd member of Trump's Cabinet had to resign.
__label__-1	The Romney campaign has announced another reboot.
__label__-1	Jesus that little?
__label__1	As long as their only abusing blacks
__label__1	If he was armed with high powered guns or explosives he would still be alive
__label__-1	All part of the republican-corporate plan for the country my pretties, all part of the plan.
__label__1	NOO you've got it all wrong....Obama cares about our civil liberties
__label__-1	...ahh.... So it was Clinton.
__label__1	That's why we are loved and no one ever attacks us.
__label__1	goddammnit Obama
__label__-1	Careful you'll end up on the street
__label__-1	It's not that I think she's wrong, I just really don't want 4-8 more years of POTUS involving themselves in local issues like this.
__label__1	Atleast Chelsea Clinton stays on message
__label__1	Thanks for your expert and objective analysis RedState!
__label__-1	Nice of him to take his snout out of the trough long enough to squeal for the cameras.
__label__1	I saw thar truck near Hillary Clinton's house after she was asked to publish the speech transcripts.
__label__-1	Remind me again how Clinton was the one who's supposed to be in the Saudi's pocket?
__label__1	I choose not to own knives to statistically avoid a member of my household getting stabbed.
__label__1	LOCK HIM UP
__label__-1	I'm sure it's just an unbelievable coincidence that both Trump and Putin would announce a major policy change the same day.
__label__-1	Thought this was from The Onion
__label__-1	It takes a megalomaniac dictator with delusions of godliness to understand a megalomaniac dictator with delusions of godliness.
__label__-1	Did they draw the line at the microwave being hacked?
__label__-1	Cause she voted to give Bush Iraq war authorization that one time 13 years ago, der.
__label__1	Hey we all know the way to create Jobs is through tax breaks to the rich.job creators who will in turn give us high paying jobs.
__label__-1	This shit isn't working.
__label__1	Yay, fascists!
__label__-1	When all your friends tell you to run for President and you turn out to be the most destructive weapon Russia ever used against the USA
__label__1	"It's only ""class warfare"" when we fight back."
__label__1	I demand an apology to all those poor Nazis!
__label__1	You know, just in case Putin reneges on that Trump hotel in Moscow.
__label__-1	I don't know if you are posting sarcastically or stupidly.
__label__-1	"Republi""care"""
__label__1	"I watch Beck so I'm pretty sure the word is ""Oligarh"" you ignorant fuck."
__label__-1	canadians are already doing this
__label__-1	But wasn't this a GOP amendment?
__label__-1	Trump Youth!
__label__-1	I donated to Lucy Flores again when Bernie sent out for Lucy Flores brought in 6 figures.
__label__-1	He missed and shot someone from India instead.
__label__-1	Why does America have the right to make laws in Syria
__label__1	And what a fantastic two years they've been.
__label__-1	Of course, this will be offset by the value of the winning we'll do.
__label__1	Well, she shouldn't have gotten sick in the first place
__label__1	The Republicans are determined to stamp out knowledge of anything not in the Bible or uh say produced by Heritage Foundation or Cato.
__label__-1	will this finally be what stumps the trump?
__label__-1	NO, just No!
__label__1	That's because it's the *wrong* faith.
__label__-1	Quick, everybody download some terrorism before they get it back up!
__label__1	I'm sure this will put the whole thing to bed.
__label__1	Shouldn't we first ask bankers what they think?
__label__-1	I missed the part where Mark Cuban was running for President of the United States on the promise that he'd fight for blue collar workers.
__label__1	Oh man my opinion has totally changed now!
__label__1	way to go dude, clearly representing what the people want there.
__label__-1	Surrender?
__label__-1	Accused?
__label__1	Goldman Sachs in no way whatsoever believes they will benefit from thousands and thousands in donations and speaking fees to Hillary.
__label__-1	Please stop censoring these news articles, mods!
__label__-1	Without either Clinton would have zero chance at winning.
__label__1	Scott Walker is great.
__label__1	I'm sure Obama's ongoing drone program and the thousands of civilian casualties it has created has *nothing* to do with creating more terrorists.
__label__1	Well I guess that's one way to teach parents a lesson.
__label__1	It's cool when Democrats do it.
__label__1	And he'll release his taxes after the audit too.
__label__1	wow what great camera work, eh?
__label__1	The FBI is going to indict *any second now*
__label__-1	Black and female victimization didn't work out well, gotta try something new
__label__-1	Take him away boys.
__label__1	Well as long as cutting taxes is infinitely sustainable, I see no problem with the GOP's economic plans.
__label__1	With all the threats that Trump makes, shouldn't this just be viewed as a stand your ground case?
__label__-1	don't forget to add the costs for when the next democrat president tears it down, you know they will.
__label__1	But it means more jobs and money for the rest of us via trickle down.
__label__-1	fuck this stupid ass subreddit, seriously
__label__-1	Corporate boot lickers.
__label__1	"She's really got that ""modern conservative Jackie"" look down"
__label__1	Does the GOP need to register as a foreign agent?
__label__1	Word from the other child-molesting former Speaker of the House (he had an affair with an underage Congressional Page).
__label__1	No one could have predicted this outcome.
__label__1	Yea, why didn't that woman in her 70s go ninja on him?
__label__-1	She should use her previous defense of a child rapist as a selling point.
__label__-1	"""I'm going to reject your evidence based knowledge in favour of what will maximise my votes"" Scumbag Politicians."
__label__1	Good to see they still don't want equality.
__label__1	Just a couple of bad apples.
__label__1	Shouldn't have dressed like a slut.
__label__-1	Is this the kind of world; the Putin-Trump thug world, that we want to live in?
__label__1	Bomb 'em!
__label__-1	Surely Obama will not let this fly....sarcasm*
__label__1	Because having your ISP end up being run like the Flint water utility is a *great* idea.
__label__1	The market will take care of this!
__label__1	Who would have ever thought Romney supported crony capitalism?
__label__-1	They're 1984ing us straight to our faces.
__label__1	Words defeat numbers: Sanders is not electable even though he polls better than Clinton every single time.
__label__-1	Deep thoughts with xX420NoScope2003Xx.
__label__1	I guess President Pence is better.
__label__-1	If these idiots want war with Iran so badly send them in the first wave of infantry.
__label__-1	That sounds shady
__label__-1	No you're not
__label__1	Why vote when you have the power of prayer?
__label__1	Well is certainly helping our farmers/agricultural industry out.
__label__1	she sure can break down barriers .... between donor and politician and all kinds of other barriers too
__label__-1	"Say it with me folks, ""No Shit Sherlock""."
__label__1	It's very presidential of him to admit his weaknesses!
__label__1	Yea, but Trump just makes sense
__label__1	"Yeah, if it's one thing the Times is known for it's ""typical rumor mill bullshit."""
__label__-1	Well, both are unreasonable, extreme right wing blowhards that get more credit than they deserve.
__label__1	Is it such a bad thing to help out folks who were kind to you?
__label__1	Yeah, but where else would he go to complain?
__label__1	OMG I'm shocked
__label__1	Because the Civil Rights Movement only took place in Alabama
__label__1	If so I'm sure they all voted for Clinton.
__label__1	Thanks for the insightful article as always salon
__label__-1	So weird, they might actually be waiting for a shred of evidence or any facts to be released.
__label__-1	Hahahahaha.....hahahahaha
__label__1	I mean he famous so theyll let you do whatever you want
__label__-1	Scroll down and the next article is 'Why do Greek statues have such small penises?'
__label__1	Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrat nominee of 2020!
__label__1	Maybe he'll explain why he didn't stop the attacks on 9/11 like some republicans claimed.
__label__1	Quick get a SWAT team we've got terrorists.
__label__1	Devastating.
__label__1	you forgot his bitchin' bong, cause you know, bongs are like, $20.
__label__1	You know who else didn't drink alcohol?
__label__-1	NOT endorsing hillary clinton is essentially a slap in the face to hillary, who was his secretary of state for a period really, hillarys got this, just support the democrat establishment
__label__-1	Wishing his father would have pulled out .
__label__1	Of course it's outrageous, his kind used to be payed much more back in those days
__label__1	because both parties are the same
__label__1	They were clearly agitating those peace officers.
__label__-1	Isn't he protestant?
__label__-1	You did.
__label__1	I can't wait for Ted Nugent's video
__label__-1	At least they backed the crazy one and not the holy shit this fucking idiot can't possibly be this fucking crazy one.
__label__1	No...... really?
__label__1	That really doesn't seem plausible.
__label__1	Well at least this will help her credibility
__label__-1	I feel like Darth Sidious has been put in charge of the Jedi Order.
__label__1	Only if the homos don't destroy it first, Ben.
__label__-1	2-way: **Clinton - 50** (unchanged from last week) **Trump - 42** (+1 from last week) --- 4-way: **Clinton - 43** (unchanged from last week) **Trump - 38** (+1 from last week) **Johnson - 11** (unchanged from last week) **Stein - 5** (+1 from last week)
__label__1	We will never know their motivation.
__label__1	it's a good thing tourism isn't vital to our economy
__label__-1	resist their laws mean nothing anymore
__label__1	But blue lives matter more!
__label__1	Nice to see that the criminal justice system is being so awesome to the perps and protective of the victims and general population
__label__1	I watch Fox news because mainstream media is so biased.
__label__-1	Put that in your pipe and smoke it
__label__-1	I love lessons in reality from those who held onto the Obama is a Kenyan belief.
__label__1	Lots and lots of rallies
__label__1	Are you suggesting that those 35 Americans don't deserve permanent jobs, you commie slime-bag?
__label__-1	Don't forget that breitbart was caught hiring actors to attend liberal protests and turn them violent...
__label__-1	How's Chicago doing?
__label__1	you cant prove clinton is corrupt!
__label__1	Yeah because California is known for its common sense gun laws
__label__-1	Clinton's budget surpluses = the post-CW Peace Dividend Bush's budget deficits = the post-911 War on Terrorism Obama's budget deficits = the post-rage Socialist Takeover PS--dailykos is a supreme example of charlatan targeting of a public that has been methodically dumbed down by the education system's key players
__label__-1	Good, let him spend the rest of his presidency golfing.
__label__-1	"I like how they call Bernie the ""Vermont socialist"" instead of ""Vermont senator""."
__label__1	So as long as they all buy three less iPhones every year, everything will be fine!
__label__-1	This country is full of cruel people who don't give a shit about each other and until that changes, we're fucked
__label__-1	How about the marinara industry
__label__1	Pissing off all Hispanics should definitely help with that
__label__1	What does it matter, he won.
__label__1	How else you going to MAGA?
__label__-1	You know they'll be looking for, or be ready to manufacture, anything to distract the populace with.
__label__1	Dont worry, more cuts to education, will make it 100% and no Science, facts, will be allowed to pollute the national dialog.
__label__-1	I could be victim to some confirmation bias, but I'm really starting to wonder if there is some internal polling that is devastating, or maybe some of the early voting returns are insurmountable?
__label__1	B..b..but both parties are the same, I'm sure Democrats do the same thing all the time
__label__-1	"""It may be against the constitution but...."" Everything after but is bullshit."
__label__1	Thanks Obama!
__label__-1	"The title of that Phillip Roth novel ""The Plot Against America"" seems about right."
__label__-1	Or any other form of dictatorial regime.
__label__1	But CNN said Hillary won, why would they possibly do that?
__label__1	He wants Obama to negotiate that the Iranians withdraw from Tehran.
__label__1	Reddit... what's new online.
__label__1	Both parties are the same, man so don't vote and just stay home.
__label__-1	So they can charge more
__label__1	It's an opinion piece
__label__-1	Water is wet
__label__1	They should build better bootstraps and quit whining like the liberals they are.
__label__-1	So who takes place of Pence governor role now that's he is going to be VP?
__label__1	Yeah, when a rich second cousins of one of Americas favorite presidents, Teddy Roosevelt, entered politics, it surely was the end of the democrats
__label__1	Quick, get Miss Lindsey some smelling salts!
__label__1	Oh well I'm sure this will get just as much coverage and reverse the damage their bullshit tweet caused in the first place!
__label__1	Does this factor in the fact that Californians and New Yorkers are only 3/5 of a person?
__label__-1	Well, cut them some slack, they're still learning how to work the controls on this republic.
__label__-1	As a person the cop wouldn't of opened his fucking mouth.
__label__-1	Why does anyone even listen to Rush anyway?
__label__-1	'Murica!
__label__1	Perhaps with the mods deleting my responses, it will make you more right.
__label__1	The system works!
__label__-1	Alcoholic moron usurps military.
__label__1	Sanders has the momentum!
__label__1	That sounds like fascism though, surely we'd never elect a fascist!
__label__-1	Because it's obvious his campaign was allowed to happen as Hillary's insurance plan.
__label__-1	Can anyone tell me what's illegal about this?
__label__1	There's a shocker.
__label__1	They've probably all been paid off by Correct the Record
__label__-1	No downvote this and move on.
__label__1	We are legion
__label__-1	Bernie^would^have^won^big^ly
__label__1	Who would have thought that volcanoes might erupt or serious diseases might spread in a country this big and we should be prepared?
__label__1	fringe candidate
__label__1	Just like Russia and North Korea wonderful
__label__-1	In before ISP's giving up your computer privacy to police, the government, etc.
__label__-1	He'll just take credit for helping it get back on its feet.
__label__1	Do you really think that's the hidden message?
__label__-1	Rather kill and imprison foreigners that help US kids.
__label__-1	The fuck kinda bondage fantasy thumbnail is that shit
__label__1	I am glad the GOP is being so mature about this.
__label__-1	Sessions belongs in the cabinet...the *antique* cabinet.
__label__1	Hillary, CTR, Obama, rigged polls, maga
__label__-1	Doesn't Utah have a fleeing fellon law?
__label__-1	These people should be in prison for what they're doing.
__label__1	Of course, Obamacare only helps those that vote Democrats.
__label__-1	Bitch shouldn't have mocked him.
__label__-1	If the Moonies are freaked out, then who are we not to be freaked out at least as badly?
__label__1	Donald Trump finally takes the Conservative vision for abortion to its logical conclusion and all the other cuckservitives that are cucks for Obama are saying they don't want punishment in the event they broke a law.
__label__-1	They were protesting sarcastically.

__label__-1	When did Obama ever say that he wasn't a capitalist?
__label__-1	Lol like the corrupt corporate structure is going to do anything for the greater good.
__label__-1	He meant to beg, if anyone of you are thinking BJ thats on you.
__label__-1	Okay I'll just pretend sanders is the winner, hell why not even the president of were just making up our own narrative
__label__-1	so do I ........... and I'm white
__label__1	No Mr Walker, the scan showed absolutely no mass at all in your brain, here take these pills and the headaches should pass in about a month or 2.
__label__-1	Thank you slick rick.
__label__1	So much WINNING!
__label__1	He's going to be a great foreign diplomat when he grows up.
__label__-1	I thought Frankfort was the capital of KY.
__label__-1	The Democrats have already been purging voters from the rolls so they can shut the fuck up about voter suppression
__label__1	What is cutting aid to Mexico?
__label__-1	Was it a laugh or a guffaw?
__label__1	Shouldn't have wrecked that airplane!
__label__1	Wow this is definitely not the type of article that I'd expect to see on Newsmax.
__label__1	But what about unifying the party!
__label__1	I think people who choose to live in Lincoln Nebraska lack the imagination to be depressed.
__label__1	I'm sure Obama will reschedule it any day now!
__label__-1	Is he a Scientologist?
__label__1	I trust Paul Ryan.
__label__1	Ooh I know, let's blame the poor people, college grads, and real people instead of the banks and other multinational corporations we should dismantle!
__label__1	Yes, because gun free zones have totally been proven to work pretty well in a society with so many guns.
__label__1	"I see Bernie Sanders as an old school MoTown fan...his supporters, I think would dig the organic sounds of drum circles, and acapella versions of ""We Are the World""."
__label__1	I thought a non-fox viewer has only 3/5th the weightage as a single fox viewer has?
__label__1	What's an Eisenhower?
__label__1	Shocker!
__label__-1	Of course he sided with Russia, it's what you do when you're being blackmailed.
__label__1	Wow, this must be why he is plummeting in polls.
__label__1	Sure she first called the storm with her witch powers and then bought adds on the weather channel.
__label__1	Shocking
__label__1	But GUYS, HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS.
__label__1	Oh, but don't forget, the DNC and GOP are *identical*.
__label__1	"But your opponent is ""Crooked Hillary,"" so why are you the one who is so worried about fact-checking, Don?"
__label__1	Before I saw this I thought she was a highly educated genius
__label__1	I guess he's really making a play for the swing voter.
__label__-1	"Yeah, someone described him as ""That guy you get stuck talking to a party."""
__label__-1	They can already be Senators and Congressmen/women, so why not.
__label__1	I guess we better believe her because she said it!
__label__1	The DNC is going to start listening to him now, right?
__label__-1	And then will petition the federal government for more.
__label__1	That 1.3% is made up entirely of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet
__label__-1	Isn't it worse that Clinton *isn't* a climate change denier and still boasted about pushing fracking to the world as Sec of State (in speech to Deutsche Bank)?
__label__-1	hahah oh man americans you guys never fail to crack me up
__label__1	But that's not astroturfing, nor is it shilling, because astroturfing and shilling only happens when someone disagrees with me.
__label__-1	"""what you got to lose?"""
__label__-1	No shit
__label__1	If only we could keep blacks, browns and women from voting we wouldn't have to be concerned.
__label__-1	To keep Americans from going north the next time our government wages a war based on obvious WMD lies.
__label__1	Did....did you have a stroke writing that?
__label__1	Censorship is so patriotic and conservative.
__label__-1	Nothing to see here folks.
__label__1	Cause all teaparty supporters want to kill the president and hate gays
__label__-1	There hasn't been a 'recovery' under Obama, and there sure as fuck wont be one under either Don Trump or HRC.
__label__-1	I very much like to start my day with coffee and a bit of good news.
__label__1	Yeah what would we do without the ability of people who compromise national security through gross negligence to evade any consequences for their actions.
__label__-1	So... A random economist, not economist magazine.
__label__-1	Obama's failure to allow criticism of radical Islam is what caused this tragedy
__label__-1	The WSJ Op-Ed page: because something has to line your birdcage.
__label__1	Don't forget to vote for HRC if she gets the nomination
__label__-1	I can just see the amazing state sponsored movies they'd make about it: Nepotism Unit 45 Saving Private Erik Apocalypse Yuge Hamburger Drive Thru Thin White Line Full Metal Hairgel Spittoon Orange Hawk Down All Quiet on the Westin Front.
__label__1	But Cohen said he never was in Prague because he showed us the cover of his passport and denied he ever was in Russia so therefore he has nothing to do with Russia just like his boss.
__label__-1	Jeff Sessions prosecuted KKK members.
__label__1	But Marine le Pen said Russia is our friend and they are fantastic and putin is god
__label__1	Obama apparently, spends all his time hatching and executing evil plans that thwart the plans of true, patriotic Americans.
__label__-1	I prefer to just say Breitbart is controlled by the Illuminati, at least that's what I think I'm going to tell my coworker who is a rabid Trump supporter
__label__1	Definitely front page material
__label__1	We should put them on some sort of list.
__label__1	Of course he says that, he's a white male.
__label__-1	It's funny you think anything besides C level celeberty endorsements of Bernie are allowed to be posted here.
__label__-1	And yet not one of you cared about the Clinton Foundation taking in foreign money?
__label__-1	Then Trump clearly deserves as much protesting as possible.
__label__1	Yeah because why would any woman have an interest outside of sexual/abortion issues, right?
__label__-1	Oh, the insanity.
__label__1	Well in his defense there is no real proof other than facts and data.
__label__-1	If that were true, would Alabama still be segregated?
__label__1	No it's ironically.
__label__-1	Kinda crazy, right?
__label__1	But-but that's aid, not welfare!
__label__-1	After the last check clears, or he treats her like other contractors and doesn't pay her.
__label__-1	You can't tax or draft an aborted person.
__label__-1	After the first few times who looked at his loan applications and thought oh he'll pay us off this time.
__label__1	brb guys I am going to touch myself over how presidential he is being
__label__-1	How is this related to politics?
__label__1	But, you told me Obamacare was bad
__label__1	Right but the fact you think you think you NEED to exercise that right is very suspicious .... no?
__label__1	Having a billionaire on the ticket is just what she needs to win.
__label__-1	That's pretty much every politician though, he's just slightly more incoherent.
__label__-1	Looks like this new ground breaking evidence should help the FBI in their investigation.
__label__1	but most americans voted for trump!
__label__1	Just think of the fantastic decisions he has to come!
__label__-1	There they go legislating vaginas again.
__label__-1	What a fucking coward.
__label__1	very convincing argument.
__label__1	What does a Holocaust scholar know about Hitler?
__label__1	Yeah, but they're not real Muslims
__label__1	But they totally don't have a favorite.
__label__-1	Clearly not.
__label__1	"I didn't realize it was the trumpers who were all ""feelz before realz."""
__label__-1	Trump filled out his disclosure He's been saying that for months
__label__1	who cares about issues now, Hillary is evil and anything but her
__label__1	Yes, because not allowing them to disciminate is itself discrimination.
__label__1	I'm so proud to be a Virginian
__label__1	Now if we could only find that one thing that will turn everyone straight.
__label__1	Surely killing innocent family members of terrorists wouldn't be used as an amazing recruiting tool by them
__label__1	Yeah, that'll show him.
__label__1	Yeah, that $1.50 an hour more is really a killer.
__label__-1	Why alter the headline?
__label__1	Says the untrustworthy media!
__label__1	Yeah - Scott Walker, progressive thing
__label__1	I guarantee you HRC will be the honored on stage guest at their opening performance
__label__-1	I meant they should be charged with voluntary manslaughter you twat.
__label__1	Clash with police just like they threw chairs in Nevada
__label__-1	If we are to accept the idea that the slogan is a racist dog whistle, meaning make America how it was in the 50s again before social liberalism began to take hold, then we can conclude the cutting ties with brown people will in fact make America great again.
__label__-1	I feel like this is a win-win situation
__label__1	I wonder if the GOP will come to the rescue?
__label__1	America's true hero.
__label__1	So-called billionaires
__label__-1	Someone post the video where Cenk punks this racist old crank
__label__-1	That's only true for candidates who haven't officially been found to be pathological liars.
__label__1	a large gathering of people resulted in a lot of trash, I guess that completely invalidates everything they were protesting for.
__label__1	"today I learned that Calgary Canada was ""overseas"""
__label__-1	Spelled septic wrong.
__label__1	He committed treason by ensuring that the next guy couldn't successfully commit treason.
__label__1	I'm sure that cop will get paid suspension, like he deserves.
__label__-1	The posturing and propaganda worked, though.
__label__1	All that money he's made and women he's been with with is absolutely awful
__label__-1	Any footage of where he's been the last 50 years?
__label__1	Good luck with that.
__label__-1	Mulvaney is the kinda guy you wanna catch in a dark alley.
__label__1	Ah yes, Trump's gonna ban all medicine and make it illegal to be a doctor
__label__-1	Support the troops fuck the politicians
__label__-1	and once there really was a man on the moon.
__label__1	Yeah, Romney would have done so much better....
__label__1	This was only bad when obama did it, shills.
__label__1	He must be a traitor if he questions The Donald.
__label__1	I have a fantastic idea for a consensus model: Instead of not allowing women (who dress and see themselves as men) to go into the men's bathroom, ban the gays (men, who dress like women) instead!
__label__1	Thanks Donald!
__label__-1	It was too good to be true, god damnit.
__label__1	Poor and homeless are losers, trumps a winner
__label__-1	If we knew what everyone's best interest were, why have elections?
__label__-1	Bernie supporters need to be more aggressive!
__label__-1	Can't wait to see what the US debt looks like after more defense spending, a giant wall, Obamacare being repealed (but insurance for all), tax cuts and infrastructure.
__label__-1	This morning Fox and Friends said that this was not racially based but rather another example of the war on Christianity that Fox News Channel insists is a thing in this country.
__label__1	His wife also ran ExxonMobil.
__label__-1	They already said they were going (to try) to pick the correspondents to be allowed in the WH press corps.
__label__1	#drain the swamp
__label__1	So when we bringing them some freedom?
__label__1	But we're gonna go ahead and do the most sensible thing we can think of, blame guns!
__label__-1	Have fun rotting in your embassy.
__label__1	Well, you know what they say, a non-criminal is just a criminal that hasn't been caught yet!
__label__1	Fire bomb his campaign and get the Democrats to pay for the repairs.
__label__1	I never imagined there might be a complicated financial arrangement with Trump and the family running his Super PAC (who also happen to be the same people who fund Breitbart News and the data anlytics software the Trump campaign used (which Bannon also has a stake in))
__label__-1	Nikki Haley is an obedient servant of Israel.
__label__-1	Cringe
__label__-1	Trying to think about how many lied during their confirmation hearings is like trying to figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop
__label__1	My hero.
__label__1	I can't wait till a Republican takes office and we're back to paying .98 cents a gallon
__label__1	To the front page!
__label__1	Japan should nuke America.
__label__1	Still more than Obama created!
__label__-1	Since 80% of us have to go anyway I guess California would prefer dehydration and starvation over common illness.
__label__-1	But we've always I been at war with Eastasia.
__label__1	We're going to get everything and pay nothing
__label__-1	Better do it within three days Jules
__label__1	We're saved!
__label__1	can't let your guard down, he still has 2 more days to take all our guns and lock us up in FEMA camps.
__label__1	The pivot is working!
__label__1	Props to the mangina that wrote this article.
__label__-1	Can't be any more dysfunctional.
__label__1	These two things must be totally unrelated and in no way have racist intent.
__label__-1	No, Trump will allow good art - portraits of him, portraits of cowboys and soldiers, portraits of battle scenes - maybe even that art of the Dallas Cowboys as cowboys.
__label__1	That's why they voted for Trump.
__label__-1	Did anyone tell you that the Democrats have been funding both wars and not imposing any kind of requirement to begin winding them down and/or withdrawing?
__label__1	Because *that* would be an unconstitutionally broad invasion of privacy, unlike having the NSA spy on *everyone*.
__label__-1	But he still supports a candidate that violated the embargo?
__label__-1	Oh shit.
__label__-1	$1000 must go a long way in Louisiana.
__label__-1	In an ideal world, politicians that say stuff like this would be purged.
__label__-1	"They should rename their store to ""Memories of a full bank account"""
__label__1	So much small government
__label__1	Nah, this will be one of them fake.polls the media has made up to somehow try and make him look bad.
__label__1	How many jobs did that create in Atlantic City?
__label__-1	I'm still kinda morbidly curious about the pyramid thing, is he or is he not aware that pyramids are like 99% solid stone blocks?
__label__-1	Please pay attention Trump.
__label__-1	Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Kennedy Coup d'etat, all just blips.
__label__-1	"I heard ""the blacks"" (his words) love him too."
__label__1	"""Hand over all clothing and gold emojis before entering the detainment showers."""
__label__1	We need to work 80 hour weeks for $2/hr because in order for America to be great again we must be like China!
__label__-1	They'll require you to let everyone know about what your birth certificate says, but you can't know what is in the water you drink.
__label__-1	Who?
__label__1	there's no proof behind any of it, but it *feels* like it should be right, so let's run with it.
__label__-1	This guy is punching holes in the bottom of the USS America as fast as he can.
__label__-1	Lets play the whose the most terrifying person in the incoming trump regime besides the orange monster himself.
__label__1	Remember its all lies from Sanders, she hasn't taken any money.
__label__-1	Hmm, someone didn't get promoted?
__label__1	Talk about reversed stereotypes
__label__-1	Hey Karl did Obama win Ohio in 2012?
__label__-1	Something something Florida Oh shit, let me guess, Rick Scott has something to do...........aaaaaaaaaand there it is.
__label__-1	Ok, I am frightened by the conflict of interest in the incoming administration, but $420,000 is so minuscule on the scales of governments.
__label__1	"Not a big deal at all, unlike that ""terrorist fist jab"" he did with his wife."
__label__-1	El oh fucking El
__label__-1	Is there a Wawa near the white house?
__label__-1	Seriously whats with all these people coming out of the woodwork to tell us how much shittier trump is as a person after he is pretty much cemented to be the president?
__label__-1	Government: the more the merrier.
__label__-1	She also thinks she was a wonderful CEO, go ahead and try finding anybody that was under her who agrees.
__label__-1	Because stress, anxiety, and hunger pains really helps a kid focus on his/her schoolwork!
__label__-1	Because he doesn't think it is fair that civilians can't become POWs, too?
__label__-1	Or 15
__label__1	If only Hillary hadn't normalized political violence by offering to pay legal fees for violent supporters
__label__1	Got to stop that mad Bernie Sanders taking busloads of people over to Canada for cheaper medication, it's hurting our pharmaceutical industry.
__label__1	Man there sure are a lot of terrorists they are tracking down and catching.
__label__1	Patriotic Republicans afraid of voters, who knew?
__label__1	Yes, we should listen to the McDonald's delivery boy/manservant.
__label__-1	Who would have guessed Goldman Sachs was a liberal spy sent to infiltrate Wall Street!
__label__-1	When it comes to preserving abortion rights, and women's health, in this country, we CAN trust Hillary.
__label__-1	Damned Russian hackers!
__label__-1	I think that'd be the furthest thing from patriotic.
__label__-1	no they dont
__label__1	Doesn't everybody?
__label__-1	Can we pin these job losses on Trump?
__label__-1	She should run.
__label__-1	Does this position need to be approved by the Senate?
__label__1	That's because we all need to hoard non-perishables before the end of days.
__label__1	Obama's fault!
__label__1	Obviously nepotism is a good thing #maga
__label__-1	Oops.
__label__1	That certainly doesn't set any dangerous precedents
__label__-1	"Maybe Ivanka told him...*""it's either CNN or Holiday INN""*"
__label__1	I'm sure it was those filthy Clintons again.
__label__-1	"If Trump fires Bannon, and it is because of the ""President Bannon"" jokes and how they made him feel lesser-than... then we have some serious problems."
__label__-1	Looks like simple economic anxiety to me.
__label__1	seems legit
__label__-1	Dumber than a bag of hammers
__label__1	I mean, pull up your pants already, amirite?
__label__-1	Because both parties are the same right guys?
__label__-1	That sounds really patronising.
__label__1	Well, it isn't like the Coast Guard is part of the military and our first line of defense against outside threats.
__label__1	Can't wait for those healthcare premiums to go back down once it's repealed.
__label__1	Why talk to the Press when they're the enemy?
__label__1	Trickledown economics, climate change denialism, religious kooks on the supreme court.... boy, we sure can afford a Trump presidency!
__label__-1	More and more are waking up to the fact that there is no god.
__label__1	Good job Texas.
__label__-1	Can you seriously not understand the difference between a public forum (which has no prerogative to be neutral), to the media which was established on the very concept that it was supposed to be neutral?
__label__-1	*shakes his head and smirks*
__label__1	Yeah, they all started supporting her after letting the people decide and didn't support her from the very beginning of the race thanks to quid pro quo arrangements that are in effect bribery.
__label__1	Fake FBI.
__label__-1	Hahaha good luck
__label__1	Yes, but Hillary was going to start WWIII with Russia over no fly zones in Syria!
__label__1	But wut about when Hillary and Bill stole all the silverware when they left!
__label__-1	We are definitely all going to die.
__label__1	Great a Commie as the head of the FBI... just another signal that our country is headed in the wrong direction
__label__-1	I'd rather have a president fighting against the mainstream media than one colluding with it
__label__-1	Supporting Hillary because vagina is totally cool tho.
__label__-1	Republicans work hard to accomplish nothing.
__label__-1	This small government will fit nicely in Trump's hands.
__label__-1	Something he learned from John McCain?
__label__-1	Seems about right, I mean we did get a President that had zero governing knowledge?
__label__-1	This election has opened my eyes to how much of a circle-jerk minority voice Reddit subreddits are, and how they don't represent the general population even 1 iota.
__label__1	I'm sure a solutions-oriented guy like Cruz will have no problem getting legislation passed to fix this.
__label__-1	what is a trump anyway?
__label__-1	100% of Americans have the gov't they deserve.
__label__1	Oh well now that Sanders said it instead of everyone else Sessions will have to resign
__label__1	But I thought the rest of the world didn't respect us under Obama!
__label__-1	It's telling when the _donald trashbuckets avoid threads like these.
__label__-1	This is hilarious, every time Clinton gets caught lying about everything the DNC brings up Russia.
__label__-1	And he won the primaries because Republicans are out of touch.
__label__-1	Just tell us if he had ever worked for Donald.
__label__-1	Is it really a fundamental right?
__label__1	because THAT never happened before Obamacare.
__label__-1	Can do!
__label__-1	Conservatives are basically against anything and everything.
__label__1	Thanks Jared!
__label__1	But camping is a legitimate strategy!
__label__-1	I couldn't understand anything Juan Williams was saying over Hannity's whining.
__label__1	Kaine speaks Spanish, just like my abuela
__label__-1	The problem I have is that the President is like a lot of my Republican friends and family that think that Lincoln wasn't a progressive and was a conservative like the modern day Republicans.
__label__1	Yeah they totally didn't mention that Trump is evil and will destroy America if elected
__label__1	that TRUMP brand is really taking off
__label__-1	But you have plenty of people jumping to conclusions as well.
__label__1	But Dems won't give this issue up!
__label__-1	And a couple on the south with the highest natural disaster rates as well.
__label__-1	Um, I should fucking hope so!
__label__-1	....was it legal before?
__label__1	Shocking!
__label__-1	De nada.
__label__1	Clearly this proves that Hillary Clinton is corrupt.
__label__-1	So you'll go full bore conservative because your preferred candidate didn't win the primary?
__label__1	This is great because Mississippi is an important state for Democrats in November.
__label__-1	"Let's hope he does a better job than Flynn.The article cited that he ""might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent war thinker,"" which I hope means he's a strategist, not a belligerent."
__label__-1	In a week we will learn that this vandalism was perpetrated by a Jewish SJW.
__label__1	CIA also confirmed that the entire sexual act was completed inside of a Vine video &amp;nbsp;
__label__1	This sounds exactly like something a party that is clearly concerned about lawfulness and their country would do!
__label__-1	Good
__label__1	Children deserve to live a life of crippling health issues!
__label__1	That'll show 'em!
__label__-1	You won't BELIEVE the number 58!
__label__-1	Breaking News: Anthony Weiner has sent a picture of his penis to a horse.
__label__1	Such a great negotiator.
__label__1	Millennial aren't having families anyway, so it's alright.
__label__1	Oh no, Sanders is helping Trump again by speaking the truth
__label__-1	It is not a hate crime when whites are attacked.
__label__1	The real question should be, what does Carter have to hide?
__label__1	Meanwhile Putin reminded him how a shiver ran down his spine when the first drops of warm drizzle hit him from the top.
__label__1	This can't be true because our leftist overlords say that gun sales are in sharp decline as 90% of EVERYBODY is in favor of anti gun bills.
__label__-1	So when their state goes bankrupt and their unemployment goes though the roof they're going to blame Obama right?
__label__1	This will make it easier for poor people to get out and vote.
__label__-1	Could they be held legally liable for the deaths that could be shown to be attributable to a lack of insurance but would have been covered under the obamacare they were denied access to
__label__1	It will open up a lot of jobs.
__label__1	That was the most well kept secret in the world.
__label__-1	"I bet they are all, ""we really need people to load our sites so that we get ad revenue."""
__label__1	Just because you came here ~~il~~legally doesn't mean you should get to stay.
__label__1	"""Who's got 'economic anxiety' now, libcucks!"""
__label__-1	Missed the spelling and presumed we were talking about Jimmy Fallon and Jim Brewer.
__label__1	What a mess, it was yuuge
__label__-1	Nominate Hillary at your own peril.
__label__-1	Wonder how all the southern red state housewives who claim an undying love for Meryl Streep and all that she stands for feel about this.
__label__1	If the people around him were armed with axes too, this wouldn't have happened, right?
__label__1	A promise is a promise, right?
__label__-1	ITT: CTR shills.
__label__1	Oh, there for a minute I thought Kansas was done for.
__label__1	Americans are right to fear the evils of socialism, just look at the hellscape that is Scandinavia!
__label__1	Clearly the wind has to work harder to move the turbines therefore making the world get hotter.
__label__1	No bias here
__label__1	Improving things for non-billionaires is contrary to Republican goals, so Obamacare must be destroyed.
__label__-1	2nd amendment strikes again
__label__1	"""uggos go over there, hot moms can come over here, and girls I'll be dating in 10 years over there!"""
__label__1	But what about the EMAILS?
__label__1	Shock.
__label__1	This is so democratic!
__label__-1	Oh hello karma.
__label__1	Oh no, Madonna is done now
__label__1	Because Jesus was all about superior firepower.
__label__-1	Schizophrenia
__label__-1	The only reason she and her peers are so adamant about gun control is that they know when the people have had enough, they'll be the first assholes dragged to the guillotine.
__label__-1	Hell, you can't really blame them for that I suppose.
__label__1	Tune in next Sunday when Murdoch announces the creation of a new Sunday tabloid: News of the Universe.
__label__1	I never would have seen this coming.
__label__1	We know from what happened with Hillary, that they'll want to investigate this six or seven times, spent several years and leave no stone un-turned.
__label__-1	Could someone tell me how this old loon is still relevant?
__label__-1	We've known this for awhile now
__label__-1	It's almost like he doesn't really want to be President or something.
__label__1	This is sure to bring her down!
__label__-1	Yet another new low in Trump's cabinet in a furious race to the bottom.
__label__-1	I'd wager a bet on Dems rejecting more white interns than GOP rejecting minorities.
__label__-1	I love how the entire internet is seemingly against the republican party because the party is comprised of retards and yet they're still going to win a pile of states... how fucked is your country that these idiots are actually getting votes and WINNING?
__label__1	Because Spike Lee did this we should immediately stop demanding justice for a murdered boy... there is no other option.
__label__-1	Isn't it better for business if they promote that thieves BUY new phones rather than reward them with stolen ones?
__label__1	All the more reason why she should be elected to the most powerful position in the world.
__label__1	"They aren't part of the ""true faith""."
__label__-1	Horrendous
__label__1	It wouldn't be a majority if they didn't poll all of those illegals.
__label__1	Remember, trump knows better than the generals.
__label__1	This will surely be the end of drumpf
__label__1	"Donald ""grab 'em by the pussy"" trump respects women in a way no other man can."
__label__-1	Because even Bernie himself isn't pure enough for them anymore.
__label__-1	But then his friends over at Dyncorp won't make any money, and he won't make any money... :-(
__label__-1	In my opinion, those young people should at least get employed in the scientific field or a STEM-powered occupation if they can.
__label__-1	Fourth amendment?
__label__1	Cleary shills
__label__-1	Can someone show me proof that he made any promises on his cabinet?
__label__1	well he is a Muslim After all
__label__1	...complains about long wait times for room service delivery.
__label__-1	He just has an alternative state of residence.
__label__1	They could be a libertarian.
__label__1	Apparently a bunch of BernieBros are running rampant from within the Democratic leadership with all this sexism and misogyny of suggesting to replace Hillary Clinton.
__label__1	Boy I'm glad to see they are saving money by limiting how many fax machines the DoD can have!
__label__-1	But, but jesus and free markets and traditional families?
__label__1	Ya'll enjoy your hatefest against teachers and schools, the conservatives need to stop all tax funded education, you must help.
__label__-1	Tough luck, maybe next time there will be other options who are not under 2 FBI investigations, get thrown in a van like a sack of potatoes after 1 hour in warm weather, did not rigged the primaries, has a message that actually means something for the common people, etc etc etc Wehn Bernie fills stadiums and the other candidate can't fill a living room without having people dragged over maybe you'd think they got the hint
__label__-1	Deja vu all over again.
__label__-1	This is hard for people to hear, but totally true, and it cuts the heart of what's wrong with liberalism
__label__1	Yeah and it was just like slavery I'll bet too.
__label__1	I feel that some mansplaining is necessary here to say that it was never ever up to them.
__label__-1	Umm it's been that way forever.
__label__1	"WOW, now that's the kind of repercussions that say ""we understand the seriousness of this situation""."
__label__1	At least this is getting more civilized than a playground scrimmage.
__label__-1	The bible condones slavery, but your religious freedom stops at the point where you violate our current laws and try to actually own another human.
__label__-1	HAHAHAHAHAHA this sub is so damn salty
__label__1	"Romney: ""See, now that I won the debate, employers are now excited about my upcoming victory and are hiring again!"""
__label__-1	I know deep down Spicer is a patriot he knows he's serving a very wrong administration.
__label__1	I bet she was the second getaway driver and sold crystal meth to middle schoolers and is fat and ugly too.
__label__-1	Doesn't matter.
__label__-1	sorry dog
__label__-1	Fareed Zakaria is a muslim plagiarist and Hillary shill.
__label__-1	shockingly?
__label__-1	That usually happens when you sell your soul to the ones who want to take advantage of the young americans.
__label__1	But it's just the Earth's natural cycle!
__label__1	I'm so happy that the GOP is the party of small government, woooo!
__label__1	The best Accountability.
__label__1	He should have, would have gone so much better for him.
__label__1	Clearly a rigged election
__label__-1	there is a black guy in there
__label__-1	Why can people not see that Cruz is a lot scarier than Trump?
__label__-1	TIL microwaves have the infrastructure necessary for visual recording.
__label__1	He hasn't finished downloading and reading it, so he really can't say
__label__1	Ron Paul has been saying this forever... I guess Chris Hedges is a crazy tin foil hat wearing nut job too
__label__-1	You can make yourself sound really impressive if you just make shit up.
__label__-1	they should diversify to make Li batteries.. then electric cars will boom... then they can go back to installing brake cables .
__label__-1	More trickle on economics?
__label__1	Wow, a state senator
__label__1	Pshhhh, terrorists can't be white.
__label__-1	Oy, never forget, goy.
__label__-1	Some people like to live in fear.
__label__1	i, for one, am shocked
__label__1	Huckabee will never be President because he didn't wear a little flag on his lapel, not because of anything he said.
__label__1	THEN DON'T FORGET TO PHONEBANK CANVASSING DONATING YOUR RENT MONEY FOR THIS MONTH TO HIM AND WE CAN MAKE HIM PRESIDENT BUT WE DON'T VOTE SO IT DIDN'T MATTER LOL.
__label__1	Generalizations are always right.
__label__1	And yet he still won!
__label__1	Yeah, but those jobs don't count.
__label__-1	Trump has supporters because he said he was going to accomplish great things... why are there still Trump supporters?
__label__1	Yes, because displacing millions of voters(in major cities, which usually vote democrat) in a swing state notorious for messing up elections, is exactly what liberals want to do, a month before an election.
__label__1	Cops can do no wrong though, at least, that's what Blue Lives Matter &amp; All Lives Matter activists tell me.
__label__-1	Murdered the American tourism industry.
__label__-1	Oh yeah good point he did get bin laden lol.
__label__-1	Go go buy guns help the economy!
__label__1	But people had to vote for Trump, because Hillary was too hawkish.
__label__-1	Populist fear-mongering swill.
__label__1	I am sure this will help the economy and create jobs.
__label__1	Yeah but he's never invented anything, and all his supporters are unemployed.
__label__-1	AKA participating in democracy.
__label__1	Yeah, this is totally bigger than CERN and the Eurozone Crisis
__label__1	And the Gulf will finally be restored, and those who've suffered reimbursed.
__label__-1	Only Americans are crazy enough to think this is a bad thing.
__label__-1	but Family Matters was about a black family.
__label__1	Palin with an ethics violation... I'm truly shocked.
__label__-1	Nice....more fearmongering for us to digest.
__label__-1	Hillary/Cuban ticket...Hillary ultimately gets indicted/impeached/thrown in jail...president Cuban?
__label__1	Because Communism!
__label__1	Yes of course Hillary is for playing an even hand in the middle east.
__label__-1	Not saying it's true because I don't know what to believe anymore, but if Russia's goal was to undermine our faith in our institutions, then it's evidence like this that shows it worked.
__label__-1	Ffyuu
__label__-1	Neat
__label__-1	You can't have your cake and eat it too.
__label__1	All hail President BANnon!
__label__1	Really sounds like he's got his heart and soul into the job
__label__1	You could tell they really had a bond
__label__1	well... there it goes... welcome to communism I guess.... people will really miss their freedoms.
__label__-1	"Comments here so far are funny... Trillions wasted on war ""OMG we could have rebuilt our infrastructure"" Trillions spent on infrastructure ""OMG just wasting money... I wish my internet was faster"""
__label__-1	In response, Republicans will be forming a special Benghazi task force.
__label__1	But that prevents winning!
__label__1	How dare he!
__label__-1	if it existed i would support it.
__label__-1	2nd day after getting elected, Trump fires someone.
__label__-1	That's one jerk of a teacher.
__label__1	How kind President Trump, you are such a benevolent leader
__label__-1	Yes, but access to abortion is a basic human right.
__label__-1	I want to get off 2016's wild ride
__label__1	Stupid establishment Asians
__label__1	Well, we don't know who Trump was asking if it was okay to use nukes on.
__label__1	Because they offered her a pay-cut, those bastards!
__label__1	But she is a women and has the right to talk, he is a man and should be silent.
__label__1	Mexico confirms this.
__label__1	Oh I'm sure Obama is going to be real tough on his donors.
__label__-1	lol he broadcasts from home
__label__1	I am waiting for President-elect Trump to tweet that he has the best magicians performing since he has been told that everyone is disappearing.
__label__-1	Offfff course he does.
__label__1	More like Shillery's economists.
__label__-1	Trump supporter confuses 'slush' with 'sushi', embarrassing himself on the internet.
__label__1	But he has the best words
__label__-1	That's like saying good on (random person) for de-armenianing the armenian genocide.
__label__-1	I can't wait until he drops by my state and lectures us about Oragon.
__label__-1	Fuck you Joe Lieberman.
__label__-1	Ha!
__label__1	"No I'm positive that she said ""we'll raise taxes on the middle class"" and got an applause break."
__label__1	#SPICY
__label__-1	Add one more to the list.
__label__1	And the Kochs are already working on that, so go find something else to do Trump.
__label__-1	Why do I have the feeling that Trump is just tossing out balls and play fetch with the media, to distract the media from the more serious issues, and the media just goes along with it and catches every ball?
__label__-1	Wouldn't be news if they hadn't been white.
__label__-1	Ad hominem.
__label__-1	That's 12 points higher than it should be.
__label__-1	It tells us what your priorities are tho Medicaid needs to be skinnier, but Insurance fat cats need to be fatter Come on, man
__label__1	That Jade Helm thing was pretty back for Texas.
__label__-1	Who?
__label__1	We should blame Hillary supporters for this with no proof.
__label__-1	Someone should have just dropped trou right there and shit on that table.
__label__-1	I'm pretty sure it was numerous women that dropped the rape accusation on Bill Clinton, Trump is just repeating them.
__label__1	MMW, this is the beginning of the end for Trump!
__label__1	This was actually the result of Chinese hackers, so it doesn't count.. move along, nothing to see here.
__label__1	But the sequester is destroying our military readiness.
__label__-1	He's just doing what he can for ~~all Americans~~ corporations.
__label__-1	'Even though 1/5 of the district can't legally vote'.... like that ever stopped democrats,
__label__1	No one could have seen this coming!
__label__-1	Yea, But Trump's a Fucking idiot with a nice suit and a merkin cap.
__label__1	Because Trump is saving the lives of innocent babies.
__label__-1	This is delusional.
__label__1	More fake news from the liberal MSM.
__label__-1	Hannity, not Bannon.
__label__1	Rigged....
__label__1	The mark of a person who is clearly not petty and just wants what's best for everyone
__label__-1	Who the hell do these rich motherfuckers think will be able to buy their products if no one else has any money?
__label__1	BUT HE SPEAKS HIS MIND, THAT'S WHY HE'S GREAT!
__label__-1	"""Ertel would not divulge who received votes in the fraudulent Seminole ballots""...... why not?"
__label__1	Mission Accomplished!
__label__-1	Well, a lot of brokers ARE republicans, so that got that going for 'em.
__label__1	Just another example of how big government liberals are pushing private business out of the market.
__label__1	Thank God we have an AG who openly supports legal marijuana, and intelligently dismisses the ludicrous views we owe to the Nixon Administration.
__label__-1	But challenging the solutions is acceptable.
__label__-1	If there is one thing Reddit teaches us, its that a loser with 2.7 million upvotes is still a loser.
__label__1	#Let's protest reason and logic @ a Bernie rally!
__label__1	Look, I'm not saying cliamte change is not real, but if I was China and made it up to make the US businesses incompetitive, that's exactly what I would tell them.
__label__-1	That 1000$ or more column though.
__label__-1	I think the drain is clogged
__label__-1	And it would only take 1 second amendment folk-person to stop Trump.
__label__-1	So, should I turn myself in?
__label__1	You have to listen to what he means; don't take him so literally!
__label__-1	Pretty much everything looks like the lesser of evils when compared to Hillary and Donald.
__label__-1	Listen to the song at least once before commenting.
__label__-1	He is not even in the top 10% with that salary.
__label__-1	This is what happens when you puss off the majority of the voting population and therefore lose the majority of your power.
__label__-1	Oh wow this guy will literally try anything.
__label__-1	It's constitutional so no.
__label__-1	Get this bullshit propoganda out of here.
__label__1	I'm certain you wouldn't be whining about Clinton not following standard IT security protocols if she hadn't properly wiped her HDDs and destroyed her mobile devices before disposal.
__label__-1	Hateful bigoted speech is protected, until it is used to incite others to violence, aka breaking the law.
__label__1	America was pretty great before slaves got their freedom
__label__-1	And?
__label__-1	Guess we shouldnt elect Bill
__label__-1	OK, but votes have to be apportioned by value of land
__label__1	But they were all violent thugs who deserved to be shot!
__label__1	Black history month IS almost over.. so...
__label__-1	He needs to protect his citizens and not worry because Donald was referencing when he saw an article on Sweden.
__label__1	shh, white trump supporters know more about you than you do
__label__1	This must be one of those phony polls
__label__-1	Only public schools mind, those charter schools can do whatever they want as long as they keep ponying up the donations to the GOP.
__label__-1	does this honestly surprise anyone?
__label__1	you're not allowed to changed your opinion from 10 years ago
__label__1	But Hillary and Bernie are essentially the same!
__label__1	no influence on hillary at all right guys?
__label__1	Damned socialist.
__label__1	Omg, how will she recover?
__label__-1	"This isn't ""clashing"" in the same sense as when OWS ""clashes"" with police, right?"
__label__1	Here comes all that voter fraud!
__label__1	"""Why not?"""
__label__1	SURPRISE!
__label__1	I think they are covering up his poisoning by a secret Kenyan Muslim.
__label__-1	Soon it will be a common belief that the media covers up terrorist attacks and lies about crime rates because of liberal political correctness.
__label__-1	Interestingly, Reuters/Ipsos had Clinton at +11 4 weeks ago and +5 4 days ago.
__label__1	Both sides are the same.
__label__1	trump cannot fail only be failed.
__label__-1	He'd be a stereotype!
__label__-1	This is probably 50% to do with Trump's anti-immigrant and trade rhetoric, and 50% to do with outright rejection of Hillary by the tradesmen due to her time sitting on the board of Walmart and watching as they busted the fuck out of any workers that even dozed off and dreamed of unionizing
__label__1	it is never too soon for the president to defend the freedom of speech and expression.
__label__-1	Booker better get to packing.
__label__1	Sure but if we had no muslims he'd have had nobody to shoot.
__label__1	Barbara Boxer, Conspiracy Theorist
__label__1	guys stop persecuting her, this is like the salem witch trials all over again
__label__-1	you also conveniently forget that there is no national sales tax.
__label__1	Today in the news unbiased journalism reaches an all time low
__label__-1	Not wanting to see their investment tank, understandable when you realize she's tied to Wall Street and corporate interests.
__label__1	what a loss
__label__-1	He should try qualifying his adjectives with details one of these days.
__label__1	downvote for lack of zaboomafoo
__label__1	maybe trump will solve their problems by saling all his crap (and family) at incredible savings with coupons to loyal party members
__label__1	I think they should take a vote to see if thats really what the people want.
__label__1	Because those pregnancies caused by car accidents are such a big problem.
__label__-1	If only someone could have warned us before the election!
__label__-1	holy shit, move on people.
__label__1	My favorite thing he did was do nothing to stop the NSA and other government agencies from completely dismantling our 4th amendment rights.
__label__-1	But did he request the use of it, that is the question.
__label__-1	Great to have someone on the court that respects the constitution.
__label__1	Jill stein is obviously sexist
__label__-1	Low Energy
__label__-1	261 days
__label__-1	But the empty folders!
__label__1	To where....New Jersey?
__label__-1	Still waiting on Republicans to ban abortion.
__label__1	"CNN quoting a ""post from Facebook""... Great journalism"
__label__1	See, those gays *are* affecting us straight people!
__label__-1	There's nothing I want more!
__label__-1	Except no one has been laid off....
__label__1	Well that's just nitpicking, isn't it?
__label__-1	Why would you respect someone who supported a sexual assualter?
__label__-1	~~Drain the swamp~~
__label__1	No potential for conflict of interest in this practice.
__label__1	Because once America sees exactly what the tea party stands for they will embrace it wholeheartedly.
__label__-1	"Uh... ""science"" is the foundation of education... not simply a subject."
__label__1	We are far too bush repealing Obamacare and redefining rape to be bothered with that.
__label__-1	Jesus, how do we have these sorts of fucking idiots running anything.
__label__1	The best way to attack Trump is say something/anything negative about him.
__label__-1	you try to do the right thing, and everyone still has their hand in your pocket.
__label__-1	A moral economy is a moral society.
__label__-1	and in other news, trump invited a foreign enemy to hack our government.
__label__-1	Let's just give the white nationalists a couple states and be done with it.
__label__-1	Deja vu all over again.
__label__1	Nothing creates jobs like firing a bunch of government employees
__label__1	But.....terrorists
__label__1	Well obviously a Hillary shill then
__label__-1	From the mind of Joss Whedon... Damn powerful advertisement.
__label__-1	Keep it classy Texas.
__label__-1	And the left wing ones don't.
__label__-1	Lol, this is what Repubs resort to when they see themselves losing.
__label__1	This won't get downvoted.
__label__1	I wonder why there's no whining about a POTUS using so many EO's... I wonder what's different?
__label__-1	Yeah, and if my aunt had a dick, she'd be my uncle.
__label__1	What a sexist pig, endorsing a woman like OMG
__label__-1	Nate Silver's polling average has Sanders with a 20 point lead.
__label__-1	Because it would cost the department more to deal with a lawsuit etc.
__label__-1	War on political correctness = Normalization of verbal abuse.
__label__-1	Barack Obama will be known as the president who presided over the widening gap between the rich and the poor
__label__-1	Probably not infused with small pox....but it's been a weird election
__label__1	Well that's useful.
__label__1	Another hippie Dem that doesn't want to keep us safe.
__label__-1	Most likely fake news
__label__1	Did he read it on wikileaks?
__label__1	Which is why you should follow true sources, like Alex jones and breitbart.
__label__1	These are the types of decisions better left to uneducated religious fundamentalits who run the local school boards.
__label__1	It's probably that time of the month where she bleeds out of her whatever
__label__1	In fact he married six or seven of them.
__label__1	Yes are you kidding that's going to encourage women to step out of the kitchen we can't have that, a lead role is for a male
__label__-1	I don't understand how some people can be die hard republicans
__label__1	No doubt our elected representatives will do what's in our best interest, not simply acting out the will of the highest bidder
__label__1	Wow, what a shock,... I cant belive this
__label__-1	How out of touch are they with society that they think this is OK?
__label__-1	CTR newest talking point: Russia.
__label__-1	This corruption is why they lost so heavily in November
__label__-1	"""knowledge is power"""
__label__1	All republicans over time have caused every bad thing to happen to us..even Hitler
__label__1	Thought you knew that if Obama did it, it was only OK if a GOPer did the exact same thing
__label__-1	So many issues would go away if the president has a line item veto.
__label__-1	Followup question, is Abromovich flying to Aspen every weekend or only times when Trump/Kushner are there?
__label__-1	Not as much as someone who works for a Scientologist.
__label__-1	Not a job that *real* Americans can relate to, unlike being a Corporate Raider... I mean who hasn't spent at least one summer doing hostile takeovers and outsourcing jobs?
__label__1	Wow, what bigots, attacking a distinguished Democratic Party officer.
__label__1	Truly a shocking development!
__label__1	I'm sure this headline is 100% accurate.
__label__-1	Her lead in a metric that's irrelevant.
__label__1	Obviously this man was paid by Hillary supporters to make Trump look bad.
__label__-1	They=Me
__label__-1	Can they inform the media of that?
__label__-1	Or leftists can stop having a reputation for being violent so the security fees won't have to be so high.
__label__1	Well, he does know more than the Generals
__label__-1	Can I buy stock in coffin companies?
__label__1	The best and the brightest Alabama has to offer.
__label__1	right wing source
__label__1	The thing the Trump presidency had too much of was intelligence
__label__-1	If Trumps is wins this fucking thing America is so fucked.
__label__1	don't want them little women worrying their pretty little heads about the men's business and all.
__label__-1	Surprising no one
__label__-1	33% of Bernie supporters did not vote for Bernie, either.
__label__-1	I wouldn't count on another economic meltdown this time.
__label__1	Why would a an elected Representative care about receiving petitions from the American people?
__label__-1	I'm starting to think that Trump's supporters are genuinely confused as to which Clinton is running for President.
__label__1	This is huge.
__label__1	Just looking out for those forgotten people!
__label__-1	This was an argument with to be made three to four weeks weeks ago.
__label__1	So Qualified!
__label__1	This , of course assumes the highly unlikely outcome of Bernie Sanders losing the primary.
__label__-1	Actually you won't find many people who have voted for Hillary and are proud about it, which shows you what she really represents.
__label__-1	did he go to newton Connecticut to sign the bill?
__label__-1	Well you DON'T SAY.
__label__1	yet this has nothing to do with islam.... i think that guy forgot his
__label__1	You see, gay marriage ruined this poor woman's life
__label__1	Way to unite the country.
__label__1	His respect for women is the greatest respect!
__label__-1	Complete the danged fence.

__label__-1	Watching the bigots cost their state millions of dollars is wonderful.
__label__1	But her emails!
__label__-1	Go Rubio!
__label__-1	The number of women who claim they have been groped or assaulted by Trump in the past will likely exceed his business credit score by election day.
__label__1	If only someone would stand up for white people for once.
__label__-1	No it isn't.
__label__-1	TIL Panama only became a tax haven after this deal
__label__1	Shh, don't you know, they're both the same!
__label__-1	Let's try not getting to the point of hyperpartisanship where we start celebrating people losing their jobs
__label__1	Whitey had it coming
__label__-1	Better than 1.2 million in one county.

__label__1	Republicans didn't like Obama because he was black.
__label__-1	-scoff-
__label__-1	Oh goody, as the Bad News for Bernie submission suppression is coming to an end, Bad News for Trump submissions can start getting the suppression treatment in their place.
__label__-1	I can't believe we're living in a timeline where this piece of shit is making sense.
__label__1	So we're just supposed to let blacks and messicans vote?
__label__-1	Trump admin creating smoke screen to hide all the other things on fire.
__label__1	Gosh darn it, we need moar laws!
__label__-1	Polonium sure is slippery.
__label__1	Perhaps they would have understood the consequences better if BHO wasn't a black Muslim Kenyan terrorist that hates America.
__label__1	If God wanted you to have healthcare, he'd have given you healthcare
__label__-1	Lets downvote him because he is correct and it goes against your liberal views.
__label__1	Tax cuts for the rich are far more important than repairing/maintaining America's crumbling infrastructure.
__label__-1	"""They say good things about me, I'll say good things about them"" - Trump, probably"
__label__-1	At this point, the only conclusion I can draw is that Trump is TRYING to throw the race.
__label__1	I'm sure this will have no effect on their policies.
__label__-1	I can't wait to see what comments get downvoted here.
__label__1	This is really adding a lot to the political discussion here.
__label__1	This just proves that education has a liberal bias.
__label__1	Maybe if we allow for police torture things will get better!
__label__-1	I've seen Clinton supporters endorse the death penalty for Trump and his supporters recently on this subreddit.
__label__-1	*Autistic screeching
__label__1	Offensive things are a real issue, you liberal snowflakes!
__label__1	Oh, well that makes it ok then.
__label__-1	I know this is unheard of, but you can call out Trump's antics and still not be a Hillary supporter.
__label__-1	Do Not Trust!
__label__-1	This seems like a fairly good opportunity to join with the British boycotters and start an international News Corp Boycott.
__label__1	Shocked that this thread is down voted so much.
__label__1	Not 15 days in office and he's taking vacations... So good in the stamina department
__label__-1	they'd be wrong
__label__-1	Why is his taxes an issue?
__label__1	Yes if someone dare disagrees with your beliefs surely the honorable thing to do is punch them in the face.

__label__-1	Make the black market $$$ again.
__label__1	It's written in the Constitution, amiright?
__label__1	Yeh they sure don't hate women
__label__1	So, if I understand correctly, we're looking at a possible president who will likely bankrupt the country, while offending anyone who isn't an adult male white person, and then nuke every other country on earth while at it... It's all right... Everything is all right...!
__label__1	You have to inflame the sheeple with the appropriate images if you want them to roll over and accept having more freedom taken away.

__label__-1	I think it is out of a fear that they might headquarter elsewhere and just pay the single digit taxes there, rather than price hikes or anything like that.
__label__-1	Deny an education to the ignorant?
__label__1	Well, apparently there are a lot more jobs when people are getting paid for protesting town halls.

__label__1	Guys, it's just a few bad apples.
__label__1	"Boy that protest vote/nonvote is really paying off for us ""true progressives""."
__label__1	Well *that* was totally unexpected.
__label__-1	Huckabee proves, once again, that he is a complete and utter idiot with no understanding of science.

__label__1	But we have to remember that laws only apply to democrats
__label__-1	That's probably when he stopped recognizing it as a state.
__label__1	Considering JEB is always sad maybe this is an omen that Trump is going to win
__label__1	well, to be fair I managed to not be taxed millions of dollars last year too.

__label__-1	They want to ensure there isn't a protest vote for a 3rd party against what Clinton stands for....because it risks Trump.
__label__1	They forgot to remove pre-existing conditions.
__label__-1	Me.
__label__1	clear evidence the election is rigged
__label__-1	Every newspaper in America is owned by the people that are keeping him locked up.
__label__-1	Shillary dun goofed
__label__-1	When you are being called out by an organization that rejects the current interpretation of the 2nd Amendment according to the Supreme Court, you know your position is untenable.
__label__1	And at that time, she will finally release her Wall-Street Transcripts.
__label__1	Probably just like the, if not more, insane roller coaster and bombshells they've put on us this month.
__label__1	Trump lies to puff up his ego, who woulda thought?
__label__-1	remember when Republicans voted to not count homeless people in the census?
__label__1	When they go low, we go lower, amiright?
__label__-1	"I read ""...of Free..."""
__label__1	Has it been unskewed yet?
__label__1	Don't worry Trump will make healthcare cheaper and better while keeping everything people want and getting rid of stuff people don't want.
__label__-1	And they are not the first state to do this, welcome to the club.
__label__-1	Who didnt already know this needs to travel.
__label__1	But don't worry, the individual mandate is definitely unconstitutional
__label__1	The ''fat'' in the title is really what convinced me of her hypocrisy.
__label__1	Ha, Republican governors concerned about people getting healthcare......this has to be fake news
__label__-1	He was probably very busy
__label__1	That must be because Republicans never lose.
__label__1	I'm sure if it was reversed they would want to get rid of the EC
__label__-1	Don't spend that kind of money on your weddings.
__label__-1	So *now* NPR is listening to Sanders.
__label__1	Because there is no way people hate Trump enough to protest against him.
__label__1	Lol, but where's the smoking gun
__label__1	welp, that's it, you convinced me to vote trump
__label__1	I am both shocked and saddened by this unpredictable turn of events.
__label__-1	Florida is too close for comfort
__label__1	Good strategy.
__label__1	Our Republicans are such wholesome patriots abusing their own President is more important than working to improve their own nation.
__label__1	"""Well, you see, the problem will just sort itself out ..."""
__label__1	They probably had significant evidence that would put Hillary Clinton in jail.
__label__1	Nothing more than a mere coincidence.
__label__1	Duh, the media is controlled by the Liberals!
__label__1	Can we, the taxpayers send him a bill for the money it would cost for him to do this?
__label__-1	"I love how all these anti-refugee people are acting under the guise of ""fiscal responsibility"" as a means of covering up the fact that they are closet racists/xenophobic/just plain fearful of change/outsiders."
__label__-1	The under oath part doesn't really matter, since perjury is a specific intent crime and impossible to prove, since it would rely on evidence that Comey couldn't even produce in the emails case.
__label__-1	If anything this would mean you have to make abortion legal in case it is rape.
__label__1	Send in Scott Walker to help those GOP brethren out
__label__-1	So a hot meal is too expensive but you can spare the budget for enormous tax credits for rich families to send kids to private school
__label__-1	He should have been aborted.
__label__-1	Goldman Sachs Lobbyist and Fundraiser Brings Hillary to Dem Debate*
__label__1	So persecuted...
__label__1	"""Omg can we stop with the Bernie posts?"""
__label__-1	You do realize that there are people who are pro choice, and pro marijuana legalization and still tend to lean to the Republican Party, right...?
__label__1	I am certain they are recoverable, so long as they do not type sudo rm * -rf that is the one thing they do not want to do if they want to recover them
__label__1	And state officials really need those!
__label__1	So they're giving American jobs to foreigners at Fox?
__label__1	Well, this is certainly a deal breaker!
__label__1	If Lot can fuck his daughters, why can't I?
__label__-1	Because they have no dignity or self respect?
__label__-1	They are in a better place now.
__label__-1	\#PartyBeforeCountry
__label__-1	He's black, he's allowed to.
__label__1	Clearly just get the world to pay for it by taxing their goods!
__label__-1	Sounds like Trump is your average politician, the only difference is that all his misdeeds are out in the public.
__label__-1	Hate to say it, but it's always been an oligarchic society.
__label__1	Well, it's been a while since last US president was assassinated.. This one is not one yet but I am sure he is pissing off the wrong people..
__label__1	Don't worry, we can just pray climate change away.
__label__-1	"Or, the frustration could stem from knowing that gun control is a useless, defeated issue - and that anti-gun ""facts"" are empty propaganda."
__label__1	But all those marriages were between a man and a woman so it was totally OK.
__label__-1	Lol, was thinking the same.
__label__-1	So what you're saying is there's a painkiller epidemic in Trump states and those folks are all about to lose whatever insurance they could possibly have hoped for?
__label__-1	Surprise!
__label__-1	Being clear and all it should be easy for him to do, right?
__label__1	"What a nice ""christian"" preacher man!"
__label__1	That poor burglar!
__label__1	Two thoughts: 1) Obviously he knows there are tapes out there; and 2) Why should he change from such a successful strategy
__label__-1	I would say that if many of these Accusers would have come forward and filed police reports after it happened, we might not be in this mess with a race between a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich.
__label__-1	kansas.
__label__-1	It'll be decades before the courts are sane again.
__label__1	Having the rest of the developed world put a carbon tax on American exports will totally MAGA!
__label__-1	"""sources say"""
__label__1	Oops, but I have nothing to hide
__label__-1	I like how everyone is waiting to figure out if it's real before making their comments.
__label__-1	"Let's use some logic here: Clinton attacks Obama for taking oil money Obama wins nomination and presidency anyway Clinton: ""Okay, might as well take oil money in 2016"" If there's not going to be meaningful consequences, why not take the money?"
__label__-1	"I'd be willing to bet that a significant amount of people who are against ""ObamaCare"" have little to no issue with the Affordable Care Act."
__label__-1	They better show up at the polls.
__label__1	That's not terrifying at all!
__label__1	But please, let's keep talking about how she didn't endorse Bernie and how she doesn't deserve any respect.
__label__1	Separation of church and state is really more like a guideline, right?
__label__1	Wow what a huge fucking surprise.
__label__1	Based on his campaign rhetoric he will eliminate our government then fire himself.
__label__-1	Ad Hominem much?
__label__1	I'm shocked.
__label__1	The fact that Obama doesn't have a beard is what proves he's a *secret* muslim.
__label__1	Yeah, because so much good comes from fear.
__label__1	I'm shocked.
__label__-1	He's a bloated failure.
__label__1	"The ol' ""algorithm"" is messing up again guys nothing to see here."
__label__-1	If I had a house, and it had cockroaches in it; I would not set it on fire
__label__1	but Hillary told me Obama wasn't swayed by wall street money in all the debates!
__label__1	And they still never manged to impeach him, amazing!
__label__1	Good luck with that one.
__label__1	If you read the article you may note that they are a 50% income tax on children ages 3-12.
__label__-1	Well.. this is just horrifying.
__label__-1	Good they deserve it.
__label__1	science has a well noted liberal bias
__label__1	Score hidden... Great moderation
__label__-1	"You lost the GOP at ""facts""."
__label__1	Are you trying to tell me more people smoke weed than people watch football?astonishing.
__label__1	The only thing that gun violence, is more guns.
__label__-1	But the percentage of idiots seems to be represented quite accurately.
__label__1	This shouldn't be an issue since Republicans and churches are so generous...surely no one will go hungry.
__label__-1	Why so snarky?
__label__1	Only when Muslims are near
__label__1	And let's be honest, if you are poor and sick and live in a red state, this option must be available.
__label__-1	If an average American defaults on a home, it's because of some moral lacking on their part; if a rich American defaults on a home, it's brilliant strategy.
__label__1	They can marry anyone they want as long as they're the same race so it's not discrimination.
__label__-1	#Oh Hitlary!
__label__1	ZINGER
__label__-1	Embarrassment can only last for so long.
__label__1	Well that settles it then.
__label__-1	It doesn't matter if he drops out or not - the race has moved on without him.
__label__-1	"I don't think I've ever quoted George Carlin, but this and that fiasco in the Texas Board of Education a few years ago remind me of his bit about ""just smart enough to run the machines, but too stupid to know how badly you're getting fucked"""
__label__1	I'm sure the Republicans would react exactly the same way if the Russian hackers had helped Hillary get elected.
__label__-1	One is a feminist , the other a cunt.
__label__1	It's always pleasant to see would be dictators *always* announce their intentions before they do something.
__label__-1	1 Civil War, was not enough, we have boys to spare!
__label__-1	Anti-intellectualism is the heart of the GOP.
__label__1	Yes, I can't wait until the New York Times corporation no longer has the constitutional right to free speech.
__label__-1	The club had a guard.
__label__-1	"today's oxymoron, ""Congress to Act""."
__label__-1	Americans even outsource their reloutionary leaders.
__label__1	"I mean, yeah, fewer massacres and senseless loss of human life... But is that really worth some ""patriot"" having to wait a week to buy a gun?"
__label__1	Oh noes, what will happen to the economy?
__label__1	Isn't the republican meme always about how liberals can't handle money and budgets?
__label__1	They are busy leaking his phone call conversations.
__label__-1	So is he a liar like POTUS or just a copy-cat?
__label__1	This is the equivalent of 8 or 9 missed security briefings.
__label__1	Quit being so mean, you Jewish Communist!
__label__-1	An opinion piece from a Bloomberg journalist.
__label__1	Surely it's over for Trump.
__label__1	Next they will be telling us that is a photo of Charles Koch the great individual rights humanitarian as he, Koch so recently went on television to claim.
__label__-1	Downvoting a NYT article doesn't make it go away.
__label__-1	He would at best likely replace street violence with institutional violence, coupled with some civil liberties violations.
__label__-1	Why does anybody think Hillary helping the feds with an IT task is bad for Hillary?
__label__1	Wasn't it once part of China, too?
__label__1	And that's why Obama is responsible for this act of terrorism
__label__-1	This article violates the established policy of pretending that George W. Bush never happened.
__label__1	With eloquent spokesmen like this how can they fail?
__label__-1	I love how much of an unrelated/non issue Bill is, yet he's obsessively brought up like he is an issue.
__label__-1	Blaze orange was also an option but it was shot down.
__label__-1	That's funny, considering most people I have met have been considering the same thing if he were to win.... what a mess we are in.
__label__-1	What a strangely editorialized title (Politico)
__label__1	I love the smell of dead American soldiers in the morning.
__label__-1	Not only are they assholes, they're cold assholes.
__label__-1	That's why we should lower the tax rate--too many accountants are making money.
__label__-1	It's actually only going to be 1 trillion now that they won't have to build that moon prison to contain Hillary since reconsidering prosecuting her.
__label__1	locker room talk
__label__-1	Should have voted better.
__label__-1	Your honor, it is against my faith to allow strangers to grope me therefore, the TSA cannot make me submit to a patdown.
__label__-1	Methinks someone is trying to make up for attempting to destroy the EPA
__label__1	Because you know... the slippery slope arguments people make... are never valid when it comes to government.
__label__1	Why would he have to listen to so-called journalists from fake-media?
__label__1	This was totally unforeseeable.
__label__-1	Maybe he could pressure her into making a few pledges as the price of his endorsement?
__label__1	Oooh, the SCANDAL!
__label__-1	They hate freedom of violent religions which nowadays realistically means just one.
__label__1	Throw them all in jail, let the latin kings figure it out
__label__1	Obama is a Nobel Peace Prize winner.. he respects human life
__label__1	Shocking... Just shocking
__label__-1	We are supposed to pretend this stunt is about the veterans instead of another debate dodge.
__label__1	"I'm looking forward to the next big terrorist attack, and the ""shocking"" news that a warning was in a missed briefing (again)."
__label__-1	and here I was thinking he'd go Carson.
__label__-1	JFC, the balls on these guys.
__label__1	Obviously, Tropical Depression 9 is an Obama plot to destroy the RNC.
__label__1	Maybe NY Times was expecting them to invoke George Wallace?
__label__1	It's fake new guys all the mainstream media can do these days is lie.
__label__1	Reddit: we did it!
__label__1	Im with her!
__label__1	See, Trump is winning battleground states!
__label__1	Why talk when you can bomb?
__label__1	Needs moar Reagan!
__label__-1	Bernie should say he will run as an independent if hillary doesn't release the transcripts
__label__-1	it's considerably higher than .09% fraudulent
__label__-1	So while everyone is busy trying to make sense of Mr Trump, Ukrainians (and possibly some Russians) die because of Putin.
__label__-1	No, just individual legislatures.
__label__1	They get their news from reputable sources.
__label__1	Right, because the Clinton News Network (CNN) is an unbiased trustworthy source on this matter.
__label__1	Breaking news.
__label__-1	This should be required not charity
__label__-1	Fuel for Trumps Fire...Let's Go Trump!
__label__1	might as well not try then, right?
__label__-1	"""Fiscal conservative"""
__label__-1	lol
__label__-1	Gotta have the troops home for the upcomming marshal law.
__label__-1	Here's a reminder that Trump wants to slash funding to the Great Lakes by 97%.
__label__-1	When you get less delegates than someone who already suspended their campaign, I guess its the only logical move.
__label__1	Pizza is not kosher, mixing meat and dairy is anti-Semitic!
__label__-1	Literally a rigged election
__label__-1	Their lobbying money at work.
__label__-1	Stupid idea is stupid.
__label__-1	Yeah but they make up for it by not paying taxes
__label__1	Must mean they are for it.
__label__1	North Carolina Mccrory recount = bad, Leftie recount = good
__label__1	At least the trains will run on time.
__label__1	Its okay, that just promoting a pro business climate.
__label__-1	When my wife was 19 and in college (late 60s early 70s) her doctor would not prescribe birth control pills to her unless she was married.
__label__1	Well, they *chose* to be homeless!
__label__-1	Repost
__label__1	Why don't we just shorten the second term to 3 years?
__label__-1	The football &amp; the biscuit
__label__-1	In which Hillarista pretend to care about black people.
__label__1	If only they stopped the illegals with photo voter id
__label__-1	Quietly?
__label__1	See you at the front page!
__label__1	You spelled Tennessee wrong.
__label__-1	shouldn't be forced to pay for any of it.
__label__-1	Tough titties Stop being a little bitch and abide by the rules
__label__1	Yeah, I'm just gonna stay in my cave heated by coal too.
__label__1	"I'm sure this is all part of Donald ""Master Negotiator Art of the Deal"" Trump's plan."
__label__1	This can *only* end well.
__label__-1	So you're saying that partisanism is a partisan issue?
__label__1	And I'm sure no future major donors to Trump are in those papers whatsoever.
__label__1	California, small state, no jobs, sad!
__label__1	"Uhh I think you mean ""good business"""
__label__-1	Oh good, the American dream is dead.
__label__-1	What a waste of money.
__label__1	Who cares about the kids as long as the GOP gets to score a few points at a minority group's expense?
__label__1	Oh come on, lying to the senate should come with a side order of bacon at this point!
__label__1	Well, at least this isn't a deeply biased hatchet job.
__label__1	Hillary is supposed to be the corrupt one, right?
__label__1	I'm just shocked to hear that!
__label__1	Berniebros
__label__1	Yes, 70 million Americans are all fucking stupid based exclusively on political preference.
__label__-1	Great, now she's going to drive it into the black market and the prisons will be filled with old white men who can't get it up.
__label__1	They are just doing their jobs.
__label__1	He won, and we still don't know who he's in bed with, maybe a Russian banker he grabbed by the pussy.
__label__1	I'm sure nypost has a 'reliable' source to back up its claim right?
__label__-1	Well, how the hell else is he supposed to enjoy all of those sweet golf weekend profits?
__label__-1	I'm surprised that no one seems to question why a future senior official of the government call the ambassador of another country to schedule a phone call for a future date?
__label__-1	They're also about to attack an herb called kratom that poses no threat at all other than getting people away from their money making opioids.
__label__1	With proper identification they should offer voter ID's at a nominal fee of course, display confederate flags proudly, and give away Obama Phones to win voters.
__label__-1	These polls are worthless.
__label__-1	Who wants to see some piss play?
__label__1	Banning customers because they don't hold the same opinion as him, what a hero
__label__-1	You're all just upset you have no one to scorn or spit at as much.
__label__-1	Some people elected Trump because he is an aggressive businessman and will save the government money by running it like a business, they forgot though that he is also an incompetent fuckwad.
__label__1	Thank you for the words, mike, we couldn't have done it without you.
__label__1	This is nothing compared to the most negatively run campaign by the Sanders camp!
__label__-1	Of all the major cities I have spent time in around the world, NYPD were among my favorite big city cops for many reasons (in the past, not these days).
__label__-1	Jesus, that is a disaster for the GOP if this actually happens.
__label__-1	No we don't, it goes into escrow.
__label__-1	Blame the Reagans for that mindset.
__label__1	Because the teleprompter doesn't work!
__label__-1	Keep voting for politicians who only want more government interference at local, state and federal levels.
__label__-1	Is the presumption that you can make the horse drink once you lead it to the water?
__label__1	Remember white collar crime isn't real crime.
__label__1	You don't want to give ever a chance to actually cast a vote, do you?
__label__-1	Not that it has anything to do with Donald not being on it, but I cannot take any list seriously that actually has John McCain in the top 10 for world's greatest leaders.
__label__1	I don't understand how this could be, the media kept telling me he was a hack!
__label__-1	Thanks Obama
__label__-1	If the moon was made of spare ribs, would you eat it?

__label__-1	Is this article talking about Daschle, Clinton, Kerry, Edwards, Reid, Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, and Biden, all of whom voted for the Iraq War?
__label__-1	To be fair, Joe is an asshole who needs to shut up.
__label__-1	Lmao oh the irony of an anti-woman article calling Clinton anti-woman
__label__-1	I think you also need to roll in billion dollar corporations since we've made the boneheaded choice to treat them as people in the US.
__label__-1	Walker only cares about the CEO pay rates.
__label__1	oh my God trump told more lies about Hillary, that is so out of character for him as he usually is so honest
__label__-1	oh look trump supporters are desperately trying to deflect from the putin / trump administration.
__label__-1	Let's get Raffi to kill op
__label__-1	Just more proof that being too full of shit is fatal.
__label__1	and trump is the one who was going to start ww3
__label__1	Because the Democrats have never filibustered anything that they didn't agree with.
__label__-1	I blame gun culture.

__label__1	amuurica fuck yea!
__label__-1	Idaho, Alabama of the west.
__label__1	But you can ignore the FBI and the director of national inelegance.
__label__-1	That's his base, the fringe who think that it's ok for dozens of people to get mowed down by mass shooters because 2nd Amendment - but an embryo is worth killing over.
__label__-1	Damn, I guess it wasn't an alt-right conspiracy after all.
__label__-1	I honestly don't think anything will become of this.
__label__1	I am so sorry Pat Robertson failed to get this plum job.
__label__-1	1st mistake: Running for president.
__label__1	He has mental illness sir!
__label__1	I'm sure it couldn't possibly be associated with the high cost of health care in the USA that means that parents are much less likely to visit a GP ensuring that an easily solved minor issue can develop into a fatal emergency.
__label__1	Check out that conservative small government people!
__label__1	VERY Unfair!
__label__1	Yes, but they didn't sufficiently hurt the poor.
__label__1	Withholding education funds from a conservative state.... I'm sure that's going to be an effective means of persuasion.
__label__-1	Says who?
__label__1	But I thought Trump hates moooslims and is gonna round em up throw them all out?
__label__-1	Perhaps all these brave progressives should grow a backbone.
__label__-1	Why do you lie in the title of your post, oh Brave^TM 0 day account?
__label__1	Life in the bible belt.
__label__1	Good idea, because people getting sick is what makes insurance expensive.
__label__-1	I suspect that if the majority of senators were women, this wouldn't be the case.
__label__-1	Burkas FTW!

__label__-1	Of course she has, Affirmative Action exists.
__label__1	Omg ur so funy nd inlitened.
__label__1	Or rather, millions turned off the regular porn for an epic ninety-minute femdom feature.
__label__-1	What does it matter if men get killed on camera and the police still get off scot-free?
__label__-1	Shit, I'll pay em' 200
__label__1	Yes, because we all know Trump will fix these tax loopholes
__label__1	Making a long corrupt Texas agency even more corrupt is something of an achievement in this state.
__label__1	Yes, please, put this man in charge of the world's most powerful arsenal of weapons.
__label__-1	1 gets you 3 they'll wreck one within a year.
__label__-1	well you see, they don't mind states killing people, it is the federal government.... i think that is how they draw the line between rights.
__label__-1	They aren't going to vote for someone that just told them to drop dead, that's for sure
__label__-1	initial?
__label__-1	NAFTA was a good deal.
__label__-1	Might wanna ask her what she thinks middle class even means first of all.
__label__-1	How much property are they going to damage today?
__label__1	Yeah because Obamacare sure did make health care affordable
__label__-1	Or perhaps... it's Trump?
__label__-1	Are we really surprised?
__label__1	Yes because they are equally to blame.
__label__1	Good way to spend taxpayer money.
__label__1	Just so long as the food banks don't get it, its all good.
__label__1	Yea, that's totally it.
__label__-1	Has Arizona told us how they solved **all** their other problems before coming to this?
__label__1	Wonder who's going to come out on top in that?
__label__-1	Also: this toast is stale!
__label__-1	Well damn, if that is true I can't really hate on him for trying his best to get Rmoney in.
__label__1	My American friends are loving this.
__label__-1	Booya!
__label__1	Because if we don't fight the wars, the terrorists win.
__label__1	That's coming after Sharia Law.
__label__1	You shouldn't take acid and try to be president at the same time.
__label__1	Well, China built a wall, and you don't see any Mexicans running around there do ya?
__label__1	But Hillary operates a huge child trafficking ring!
__label__1	It worked in Kansas.
__label__-1	because nothing says a more inclusive GOP than an exclusive GOP -.- sometime i am left to wonder at their stupidity.
__label__-1	Why isn't she in jail?
__label__-1	Lol, this is the year a front running GOP Presidential candidate admitted to attempted murder and everyone's thinking nah, he dreamed it up.
__label__1	I'm sure a little war will fix that right up, right?
__label__1	Great photo op for the GOP minority outreach program.
__label__-1	"""Unelected judges from all across the country are forcing their personal feelings and biases against traditional marriage upon the American people""... Seems to me he is forcing his personal beliefs on the American people."
__label__-1	No shit.
__label__1	Obviously nothing could be HIS fault.
__label__-1	Here's an idea How about we start growing our own food and get off food stamps all together
__label__1	Hundreds, hundreds to be investigated, and that is breathtaking, now isn't it.
__label__1	doesn't he have a place in the new Administration yet?
__label__-1	"Those states probably also have easier access to birth control, and kids given some decent form of sexual education other than ""Don't do it at all or God will kill you."""

__label__1	Man, that debt ceiling fight is gonna be rough.
__label__-1	Marching forward hypocritic and Hypnotic computers You depend on our protection Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
__label__1	Oh look, the GOP wants a small government by introducing fines against people who drive electric cars.
__label__1	Relax guys, it's Reuters, typical right wing trash that only has it out for Clinton
__label__-1	He should be deposed.
__label__-1	I'm pretty simple, but it sure seemed like she lied and it sure seemed like she set up an email server to skirt FOIA I believe both of these things are true and I'm willing to bet most every single person also believes that these are true but while supporters and employees argue legal positions and present rebuttals, everyone knows these two things are true, she did lie and she set up a server to avoid FOIA
__label__-1	Another waste of taxpayer dollars.
__label__1	Lets not blame the 150,000,000 non-voters, lets blame the 90,000 green voters.

__label__-1	Now Alex is part of the conspiracy.
__label__-1	Trump is already saving USA money by letting other countries take the cost.
__label__-1	SURPRISE!
__label__1	He will likely be a well informed committee leader, open to all types of energy sources, and will be active in supporting the scientific community's urgent efforts to address global warming.
__label__-1	It's only considered fraud if he is found guilty, which I doubt will happen.
__label__-1	Trump supporters keep finding out the hard way that election fraud is not as easy or safe as Trump claims.
__label__-1	Oh, I didn't realize it was already November
__label__1	If it takes crazy people being able to buy guns to Make America Great Again, then, by God, crazy people are going to be able to buy guns!

__label__-1	Unhinged.

__label__1	That socialist bastard
__label__1	What a sellout
__label__1	Good luck with that!
__label__1	How many times a day do you thank a guy for helping you win the election?
__label__-1	Reaganism* Bushism is just reaganism
__label__-1	That's just stronger evidence that it's even more rigged, YUGELY rigged, let me tell you, bigly.
__label__1	Just because a woman happened to cross the border and give birth in less than 24 hours doesn't mean that it's an anchor baby, I mean how shallow and racist for people to determine that.
__label__-1	Oh excellent, let me just go vote based on what Variety magazine thinks.
__label__-1	How many Ivanka Trump days in New York is this?
__label__-1	Rude.

__label__1	The two time loser Carly Fiorina isn't helping Lyin' Ted?
__label__1	It's ok, the little girls family was probably a Buono voter.
__label__1	quel suprise
__label__-1	Medicare also has a 97/3 MLR whereas private insurers were in the high 70s low 80s pre ACA, now they have to be 80 for group, 85 for individual
__label__-1	If we let a few hold the bounty of our world, they will murder it and us with it.
__label__1	God Bless America and our no knock search warrants.
__label__-1	We have the best perjuries, don't we folks?
__label__-1	You realize this is ObamaCare on steroids right?
__label__1	She still needs that signed permission slip from her parents before the school of hard knocks will allow her to go on her presidential field trip.
__label__1	Lock her up too!
__label__1	Maybe he'll start being a respectable president now
__label__1	Well he is black after all
__label__-1	"As he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the EPA, protesters screamed, ""YOUR LAST TERM!"""
__label__-1	You should read about his past more bud
__label__-1	juice gotta do what juice do
__label__1	Come on guys, everyone knows Obama was president from 2000 to 2016
__label__-1	There is still a divided government.

__label__-1	Welcome to todays outrage!
__label__-1	Eat the rich!
__label__-1	Send this pig home, but not before he spends 25 years in a Pound-Me-In-The-Ass prison.
__label__1	Sometimes as a politician you have to make tough votes.
__label__1	*dons tinfoil hat* They're preparing for the coup attempt!
__label__-1	Not only are his trips paid for by us taxpayers but those payments are going into Trump's own pockets as he owns the places getting paid.
__label__-1	loooool this fucking article

__label__1	That'll make it 10x easier for immigration to catch them if they aren't running.
__label__1	These kids are the 47%, which means that they only desire to mooch off society.
__label__1	OH MY GOSH HE'S LEAVING TO OVERSEE THE GAS CHAMBERS FOR THE UNDESIRABLES!

__label__-1	"""just"""
__label__1	Please stop with the attacks, Melania is white, rules don't apply to white immigrants.
__label__-1	I'm loving how few fucks Boehner has been giving lately.
__label__-1	The GOP certainly isn't perpetuating it's misogynistic image here.

__label__1	But you know, this doesn't mean she will compromise her values in anyway.
__label__1	Drain that swamp!
__label__1	And the border is secure too!
__label__-1	That's a big-league number.
__label__-1	In the video description she says she offers her opinion then disables comments and call everyone else worthless, yup idiot.
__label__-1	The FBI has disqualified itself to investigate Hillary Clinton.
__label__1	Why would they spend so much money denying something that doesnt exist?
__label__-1	wtf really ?what a clown
__label__1	I have a feeling a lot of democrats are going to take them up on this offer
__label__1	the op is crazy
__label__-1	are we going to have another 'isolated incident'?
__label__-1	Silly rabbit welfare is for the rich.
__label__-1	I still remember when Trump had 'no forseeable path to cinch the nomination'.
__label__1	I guess this is even more proof that his family has nothing to do with his influence as President.
__label__-1	While this is pretty damning, I think it gets us all considering what would happen if ABC News sat down for an extended on-camera interview with our ex.
__label__1	Really they should give up and elect Nancy Pelosi, she knows how to run the House even when things are beyond difficult if you recall the stimulus and ACA fights.
__label__-1	Oh, god.
__label__-1	Must have been nice for the pope to finally meet his boss in person.
__label__1	"""But the emails!"""
__label__1	Good thing people that are already rich have everyone else's concerns in mind.
__label__1	Polls we can trust, I'm sure
__label__1	Yeah Rpmnet would never do that
__label__1	Right, because the no-no sub allows for reasonable discussion that challenges their worldviews
__label__-1	With hillarys numners slipping its possible many of her delegates have changed their mind.
__label__1	But she cares about us
__label__1	It sure is a good thing Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton encrypted their emails because we can't read them now.
__label__1	Trump being a master golfer and the proud owner of multiple golf courses, he's seen through your shill tactics and has realized the lower the poll ratings the better!
__label__1	"But it's all just ""economic anxiety,"" right?"
__label__-1	Which side makes them money?
__label__-1	Trump is their only source.
__label__1	Everyone knows Trickle down economics fixed this issue.
__label__1	"Yeah, I'm sure the police weren't trying to spin this by ""accidentally"" losing their body cameras."
__label__-1	You work hard to get lucky
__label__1	At gunpoint I assume?
__label__1	My country is back in the news... Wonderful... What great coverage...
__label__-1	And after the child is born, the daughter should dump the child off at the mother-in-law's house with no prior warning and no baby supplies and leave indefinitely.
__label__1	That oughta really help the US businessman.
__label__-1	Yeah while China is writing free trade deals, as Russia is abandoning US Credit Cards and hiding Snowden, our guy is obsessed with gay transgender abominations.
__label__-1	They could ask Bernie for a loan since they pissed away all their money on someone who is going to jail.
__label__-1	We could fix the entire budget if we permanently furloughed 90% of the Pentagon workforce.
__label__1	Yeah, that's why we found all those WMDs and those nuclear weapons that Condi Rice told us would turn us into a mushroom cloud if we didn't start a war in Iraq.
__label__1	Their mistake was not properly planting a gun in the car.
__label__-1	He hasn't spent the weekend at the White House has he?
__label__1	Is that a bad investment?
__label__-1	Their content and source determines whether they are classified, not how they are marked.
__label__1	Wtf I love fat shaming now!
__label__1	What a saint
__label__-1	If anyone deserves a break, it's Obama.
__label__1	Good, I have always said that the public has no business knowing what's going on in public buildings.
__label__1	Wait, Trump barred Breitbart and InfoWars?
__label__1	These Republicans that are standing up to him after the 50th thing he said that would've disqualified anyone else are real profiles in courage.
__label__1	So this thread has +300 comments and only 33 upvotes... Seems legit
__label__-1	Isn't this completely illegal?
__label__1	Certainly no double-standard there.
__label__-1	I have a feeling it's more likely that this congressman is the racist pig here.
__label__-1	Bain damaged voters can only help Trump and the Republicans.
__label__-1	They're still just lawyers, will say what they need to.
__label__1	How I love this Russian prick interfering in our country and our elections.
__label__-1	candidates wouldn't turn over the information they collect at the end of their campaigns if the DNC or state parties would then give that information to a primary challenger
__label__-1	I don't have any Muslim friends :-(
__label__-1	Clickbait title
__label__-1	Nah let's just have more skyscraper single-family residences next to trash pits where kids sleep and pick apart electronics, and vacant 98% of the year vacation villas.
__label__1	The fact that I feel economic anxiety and blindly blame Mexicans and you won't just let me do that without mocking my paranoia is WHY TRUMP WON!
__label__-1	That's why she's running for president--to pardon herself.
__label__-1	Can't wait for this to hit the front page.
__label__-1	Has The Fart managed to fill his cabinet yet?....Imagine No Ambassadors in place on 21st Jan 2017?....Is it The Fart's intention that anyone wanting to have a diplomatic discussion withe the USA having to send someone to the Court of The Fart or will just send the a Tweet?
__label__1	Very informative news
__label__1	that's because a Clinton victory is riggedly probable
__label__-1	This guy really wants a President Joe Biden.
__label__1	Big Surprise.
__label__-1	I don't know if they're intentionally trying to invent they're own reality hoping we'll believe it, or if they're all just so fucking stupid.
__label__-1	I shudder to think that Trump might be the first American president to use nuclear missiles to compensate for his tiny penis.
__label__-1	I *cannot* wait to vote against this douche tomorrow morning.
__label__-1	Establishment grasping at straws; they are scared.
__label__-1	People with NPD do it because they think they are much smarter than you, and you are an idiot that will believe them.
__label__1	So... NC didn't elect a governor over anti-LGBT law, but voted for a president and vp that are very anti-LGBT... totally makes sense
__label__-1	More like Trump is imploding.
__label__1	Your god will not save you now.
__label__-1	oh, what the hell?
__label__1	But guys, he wasn't serious about it, he actually likes the gays, he was just pandering to win the election.
__label__1	Well, it was inspected in 1991.
__label__-1	Ratfucking bullshit.
__label__-1	"How is it even possible to phrase his concept ""properly""?"
__label__1	Before the ACA no one ever went into debt for health care.
__label__-1	The man is a coward.
__label__-1	It would be funny how Trump supporters try and absolve themselves of culpability in this despicable, pointless, fascist bullshit if it wasn't so nauseating.
__label__-1	Warren Buffet's company hasn't paid taxes for the past 8 years.
__label__-1	Will you ever build that second shed?
__label__1	This is why we need laws to prevent cops from being filmed.
__label__-1	Could upstate NY actually survive without NYC?
__label__-1	time to get that shack in montana.
__label__-1	He wants to investigate the FBI for catching Flynn.
__label__1	Whoo
__label__-1	That's not what the agreement says - Read THIS one before you pass it Obama.
__label__-1	I propose an empirical test of this assertion.
__label__-1	Obama really wants to pay back his donors
__label__1	Thanks Iranian News source!
__label__-1	And you better believe whatever number trump pulls out of his ass is the correct number because it's next to impossible to get a number that big out of your ass when your head is blocking the way.
__label__1	That's why I only watch Fox News!
__label__1	Fuck Ron Paul and his consistent pursuit of common sense to solve issues.
__label__-1	And exit polls showed 50% of Clinton voters wouldn't vote for Obama in 2008 and we all saw how that turned out
__label__-1	Another example proving trump isn't serious about running for president
__label__1	Well, this proves once and for all that liberals secretly hate gays, and the whole gay marriage / gay rights thing is a total sham.
__label__1	Who would have thought that Judicial Watch was working for the Russians
__label__-1	this is the kind of people she works for, tax evaders
__label__1	Redistribute the air time!
__label__-1	When mass gun attacks by terrorists stop happening in gun free countries like France maybe we can talk.
__label__1	Least they don't let no fags in.
__label__-1	This is super ironic coming from the crew that thinks Clinton is the literal devil.
__label__-1	Politico means the Koch Brothers announced their presidential bid.
__label__-1	...Aside from whatever Fox News might have managed to make up, was there ever a poll that said otherwise?
__label__1	but its gonna kill jobs, etc
__label__-1	Jake Tapper's facial expressions are hilarious
__label__1	No he's not...he was never in politics so he's unestablisment.
__label__-1	Normally this behavior would be called insane, but keep in mind these people *voluntarily* live in tornado alley.
__label__1	Well I was already voting for Hillary but now that I know W is on board I'm really sold.
__label__-1	Literally, 1 step forward, 2 steps back.
__label__1	Nice, objective source there.
__label__1	Well if they didn't want to be poor why don't they just work hard and pull themselves up by their bootstraps?
__label__-1	BP's assets should be seized and all of their operations stopped until the current mess is cleaned up!
__label__-1	i fail to see the purpose of this law.
__label__-1	"""We shouldn't be listening to celebrities on politics!!"""
__label__-1	Bernie Sanders is a clown
__label__1	In a completely fair and unbiased primary!
__label__-1	"I have but one UP Vote - the ""oops"" by Moore would leave everyone really confused - I assume that was a feature, not a bug!"
__label__-1	"""we had to destroy the judicial branch in order to save it"""
__label__1	Finally, someone said it!
__label__-1	I'll be amazed if Spicey shows up on time.
__label__1	Well that's a good way to win hearts and minds to your cause.
__label__-1	I'm sure they will be prosecuted... or appointed as the White House Chief of Staff.
__label__1	It's comforting to know that if he had his laws passed two years ago, my brother would get executed.
__label__-1	I'd much rather it be a meaningless photo op than trump saying he's taking the country to war
__label__-1	i assume it it will also be written in newspeak
__label__1	Those weren't companies they were people.
__label__1	I believe this is what they call FAKE NEWS
__label__-1	Did they forget pissgate against Trump?
__label__-1	Can we not give this bs any attention, really.
__label__1	right, a great idea, given Trump in a party without superdelegates.
__label__1	Minimum wage workers will be saving tons of money in their freedom health savings account.
__label__-1	Got your tweezers handy?
__label__-1	Bernie bros are one of the reasons I'm switch my vote from Bernie to Hillary.
__label__1	Yeah, sending troops to Syria, leaving troops in Iraq and sending them to Libya all in order to steal oil totally isn't starting new wars!
__label__-1	When does this administration just start smoking from a cigarette holder, dye their hair black and white, and hatch a plot to steal 99 puppies for their fur?
__label__1	Quick, let's marshal all the white supremacists and have a racial war in PEORIA!
__label__1	I wonder who is downvoting this story.
__label__1	Thank you for this hard hitting journalism.
__label__1	Everyone who doesn't like Hillary is a racist!
__label__1	Uh yeah, if they don't like it, they should just get a better job!
__label__-1	But the internet told me trump did, and that President Ron Paul was born in Kenya!
__label__1	Is that before or after she ran a pedo fun club out of a DC pizzeria?
__label__1	Well at least he's not black and golfing
__label__-1	"Can't you ""power through"" leprosy?"
__label__-1	"Now can we change this stupid fucking ""Stand Your Ground"" law?"
__label__1	typical judicial activism
__label__-1	Please don't block traffic :/
__label__1	Just what we need another liberal, antimilitary, publications against trump.
__label__-1	Wow, didn't see that coming.
__label__-1	Because Shame buys a yacht.
__label__-1	Tebow wins, Palin doesn't.
__label__1	I know I go to shady russian youtube stations for all of my breaking political news needs
__label__1	Scandalous!
__label__1	That's what lakes are for
__label__1	Just make sure she doesn't vote.
__label__-1	The thing about running a business is that no matter what you do, you have to file your tax returns with the government or face serious penalties.
__label__1	Some people just work harder at keeping other people down than others.
__label__1	I for one am excited for our new Comrade in Cheif.
__label__1	Might as well stay home and not vote then am i right
__label__1	He's surely a student of history
__label__1	That's some quality reporting there.
__label__1	We have heavily fortified bunkers, if you don't than that's your fault
__label__1	Yahoo is so rightwing these days.
__label__-1	Can you imagine if he got interviewed by someone at NBC, not much of an interview would have been had.
__label__1	Yeah...look at Costco and the Container Store...they are in dire straits.
__label__1	And spent in on Trump brand clothing !
__label__-1	Donald trumps voting record is clean.. and free of any voting record.
__label__1	Shes just an object anyway, whats the big deal?
__label__1	But look at all the protests in countries with socialized medicine marching in the streets to switch to a system like ours.
__label__1	But Clinton is REALLY the pay-to-play person, glad we didn't elect her
__label__1	Well, he was a false flag Manchurian puppet set in motion by Hillary and Polestar and the RAND corporation so it doesn't matter
__label__1	It was just locker room banter
__label__1	Damn snowflakes, out in their foxholes.
__label__-1	If anyone's to blame, it's the Reagan administration.
__label__-1	Republicans just love when the government tells companies how to do things.
__label__-1	Good.
__label__-1	There is an answer, but it's not defensible.
__label__-1	Silent like a fucking bitch.
__label__-1	exactly what it is.
__label__1	During rape, they shut themselves down.
__label__-1	It's not much of a surprise, the right wing media and politicians seem to spend the majority of their time whipping up anger and fear.
__label__-1	This man is fucking dangerous
__label__1	Yeah well, I'm sure once he became president he became aware of some new information and so this all makes sense.
__label__-1	"Its interesting how many people there are that think ""Obummer"" is a clever criticism."
__label__1	She's a strong independent woman breaking the glass ceiling and she's tired of these completely partisan attacks
__label__1	That's it media you're on notice.
__label__1	Clearly the vicar of Christ, head of the oldest and most sacred church on Earth, is nothing but a globalist shill.
__label__-1	But he couldn't win the nomination, now we're stuck with Hillary.
__label__-1	He's already lining things up for the genocide, I see.
__label__1	7 out of 9 are Republicans... Wow, who would have thunk it?
__label__-1	"""The Russians did it"" is the new Democrat birtherism movement."
__label__1	Women who believe women shouldn't be allowed to vote always have the best ideas!
__label__1	Fuck no he was banging my wife the scum deserved to die.
__label__1	**FAKE NEWS**
__label__-1	Trump duh
__label__1	But Russian funding of Trump is just fine, right?
__label__-1	This conclusion seems dubious.
__label__-1	But even if they don't find voter fraud we can't trust him to tell the truth, a narcissist is not going to admit he is wrong.
__label__-1	Republicans will do anything to keep the number of abortions up in order to maintain their anti-abortion meal ticket.
__label__-1	Oh dear, I was home alone when someone broke in and accidentally raped me!
__label__1	Clearly an unbiased and trustworthy news source.
__label__1	Isn't this fun, Russia is trolling the U.S.A.
__label__1	Surely you're not trying to say an inquiry and declaring war aren't the same thing?
__label__-1	This will ensure the victory of meth and opioids.
__label__-1	Hopefully someone builds a monument to this woman or a statue or something, because she deserves more recognition than she is likely to get.
__label__1	Did somebody accidentally let Varg into the country?
__label__1	Geez, good thing Americans don't do that.
__label__1	"Is her use of the word ""silly"" thoughtful?"
__label__-1	It shouldn't have taken this long dammit
__label__1	thank you job cre(h)ators!
__label__-1	He should show his concern with his votes; his words don't mean anything anymore.
__label__1	When your claims aren't historically accurate, change history!
__label__-1	Shocking
__label__1	Clearly he's in her pocket.
__label__-1	Let's wait for Sanders to say the exact same thing so that it can get to the front page.
__label__1	Just like genocide.
__label__1	Best disapproval ratings.
__label__-1	Gotta keep them evil furriners from spreading the word of how things like universal health care are a success in their countries.
__label__-1	That's so gay
__label__-1	I did see somewhere that there was a special provision in it that left the door open for exceptions on a case by case basis, presumably for people like this.
__label__1	As a struggling billionaire, he really needs that 400k a year.
__label__-1	after?
__label__-1	ObamaCare vs RomneyDoesntCare
__label__-1	I hope Trump won't go off on him, but I wouldn't be surprised, given the fact that he's a scumbag.
__label__1	these are obviously lies from the lame stream media.
__label__1	I'm glad he is following what he said in his letter.
__label__1	Now I am positive he has brain damage.
__label__-1	Republicans may end up regretting this.
__label__1	Raping the taxpayers, feels good man
__label__1	What do you expect when the most liberal President ever in exsistence is elected to implement a radical liberal agenda and allow workers to control the modes of production as Obama obviously is doing.
__label__-1	Hey cool Nazis.
__label__1	well if they demanded it...okay!
__label__-1	Who Cares: The Article This is the biggest non-story
__label__1	Those Southern Baptists exemplify the life of Jesus so well, don't you think?
__label__-1	"""birds were chirping"" what an interesting way to phrase enormous corruption in the DNC"
__label__-1	"""It's not a lie if you believe it"" - George Costanza"
__label__-1	Thanks, Obama.
__label__1	You obviously didn't see the Lt Gov's tweet
__label__1	"His Holiness went on to say that ""all those murderous strumpets that miss this window are still damned to burn for eternity."""
__label__1	and voter discrimination laws totally are not specifically to keep these voters out of the polls.
__label__1	Clearly a racist.
__label__-1	"when will a guest ask Hannity why he pussied out on being waterboarded, or come out publicly, after kicking an offer of a Hannity interview to the curb and say ""i don't want to let some pussy who backs out on being waterboarded because his manhood shriveled up in fear interview me, it's not fair to him, i'd dominate him like the scared little bitch he is"" would be epic"
__label__-1	Shush babycakes the adults are talking
__label__-1	The cause and cure for a problem are generally not the same thing.
__label__1	That's because Republicans didn't let him spend the money.
__label__1	Didn't he copy her on the whole birther thing?
__label__1	Look, everyone knows that if Obama doesn't have all the facts about everything immediately, he is the worst President and human ever.
__label__1	Then the Pentagon is clearly a liberal organization that must be disregarded.
__label__-1	I love watching him piss his money away.
__label__-1	The fact that Hillary did some bad stuff does *not* make this a non-issue.
__label__1	OMG That's a shocker.
__label__1	There they go throwing the Hitler card, this will totally make me vote Clinton after seeing Trump called Hitler for the 70th time
__label__1	But but but I thought that people were leaving her in droves because she wouldn't stop talking about Russia!
__label__1	"Thank you thinkprogess for another unbiased, independent ""news"" article."
__label__1	for *freedom*
__label__-1	I can still discriminate against people in fedoras though, right?
__label__-1	How are Trump voters spinning this one?
__label__-1	Cry more.
__label__-1	I thought it was about who is or is not a Russian puppet.
__label__-1	Online only, not listed in rcp average, non news
__label__1	I'm sure Milo &amp;amp; team over at Breitbart will be skewering Pence for the suggestion that the world must cater to whatever happens to offend him.
__label__-1	You mean when the civil rights movement began?
__label__1	"""Officials"" fake news!"
__label__1	Christie 2016!
__label__1	I can't imagine why democrats would want to make it so illegals and people on temporary visas can easily vote.
__label__1	43 and 64 doesn't even add up to 100%
__label__-1	Oh, he'll tell you it's a good thing, but only if you live in Massachusetts... otherwise it's liberal taxation.
__label__1	Private prisons is part of Trump's plan to make America great again.
__label__-1	War costs money :0
__label__-1	They forgot: * Took Trump's Twitter fights to a whole new level on national TV by extending them into a press conference.
