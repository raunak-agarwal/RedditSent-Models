__label__1	And this is exactly why I approve of death panels.
__label__1	This is pure xenophobia against Vaticanians!
__label__-1	Teabagging apperently just the tip of the iceberg
__label__1	Those must be some pretty tough soldiers to have to put up air conditioned tents.
__label__1	"""Let's stone her!!!!"""
__label__1	Oh, those aren't *real* Christians anyway.
__label__1	We need job creators, not Bolshevik indoctrination centers.
__label__1	"That teacher just isn't a ""team player""."
__label__1	Listen I was told by ron paul people that the parties are the same and it doesn't matter if I don't vote or vote 3rd party, thereby taking a vote away from the democrats.
__label__-1	The Coulter quotes... wow, just wow.
__label__-1	"""The FBI claims to have evidence that a group of anarchists from New York are planning to blow bridges in Tampa in Florida"" And how many of the group are FBI agents or informants?"
__label__-1	then take the sum and divide by 2 - the repug way
__label__1	Good thing there weren't any of those nutjobs with CCWs there or things might have got out of hand and innocent bystanders would have been shot by those untrained yahoos.
__label__-1	Poverty line in Congo looks a lot worse than here.
__label__1	Pat Robertson...the voice of reason.
__label__1	Obviously we need to start arming bus drivers.
__label__-1	She's got another book she didn't write to sell to people who don't read.
__label__1	Impeach the sexist.
__label__1	Yeah, but how many people are employed to keep them on the streets
__label__-1	It takes all types.
__label__1	Democratic People's Republic of America
__label__1	Conspiracy!
__label__-1	Good night sweet prince
__label__1	The guy who signed the Alien and Sedition Acts said it, so it must be right.
__label__1	but its only because it a neighboring state of Vermont nothing to see here
__label__-1	So what?
__label__-1	she brought a GS lobbyist to the last debate as her guest such shaming.
__label__1	Im sure this will do well on a pro sanders subreddit.
__label__-1	The how much matters just as much as the win for both these guys
__label__1	Well, because clearly that sex is a threat to national security; the drinking water is just a minor issue for some people who really do not ever vote.
__label__1	Just yesterday I saw him ranting about going against the states that legalized marijuana... How did that not solidify his presidential bid?
__label__1	Yeah, because three strikes was way too lenient.
__label__1	I hope Madeline Albright criticizes all the women who supported Bernie Sanders instead of Carly Fiorino.
__label__1	Clinton: So like with a Sharpener?
__label__-1	One hand washes the other.
__label__-1	Freedom isn't free yall
__label__-1	AnybodybutHillary 2016!
__label__1	The catch 22 is they will first have a voter ID law that only allows registered Republicans to vote.
__label__-1	Lol @ cop doing his job with a cancer stick jammed in his mouth
__label__1	But how will this cure racism?
__label__-1	Socialism: punish success, reward failure.
__label__1	Wow what a scathing piece.
__label__-1	Hillary's numbers continue to shrink, the the differences are declining not growing.
__label__-1	Try harder?
__label__-1	Why can't they respond back with a photoshopped image of Ted Cruz and Obama talking to each other in front of the United Nations building New York?
__label__1	By the same logic, it has not influenced every other strong willed politician.
__label__-1	VP material
__label__1	Yeah, they're much happier now with ISIS!
__label__1	Well this will surely end his campaign!
__label__1	I get all my political insights from C-list celebrities.
__label__-1	Why would you want Nunes gone?
__label__1	Could he have simply forgot?
__label__-1	Can you imagine, your child was shot at school... and the audacity of these Alex Jones fanatics.. to harass you about it.
__label__1	He's only taking money from the government, not from me.
__label__-1	Something something coal something something tremendous tax cuts.
__label__-1	Slouching toward that death panel.
__label__-1	I thought Brownback was going to balance the budget with a bake sale.
__label__-1	Okay, do it Turtleman.
__label__1	But let's just see what Rasmussen has to say first, before we jump to any conclusions.
__label__1	But ensuring human rights would mean taking away people's choice (to not have human rights if they want, and their personal responsibility to have to fight for the rights on their own.
__label__1	yeah but 6/10 americans are also illegal immigrants
__label__1	Why not celebrate an enemy of the United States, who initiated a military attack and made war against our country?
__label__1	He was so successful when investigating Hillary.
__label__1	But that's in white man dollars, so it's okay.
__label__-1	Don't forget blinding stupidity.
__label__1	What better way to stop the flow of Syrian refugees than to strike at their source?
__label__1	How could anyone have ever predicted this?
__label__1	I am sure it was a secure location.
__label__1	Yeah, but we can open American missile silos!
__label__-1	More of the R's war on women.
__label__1	Didn't see this coming....
__label__1	I'm sure he's got Trump scared with the one.
__label__-1	So they've made peace on whatever started their tiff or Bannon no longer sees a benefit from it and is going for the long game.
__label__1	But those poor rural states need their insane overrepresentation
__label__1	Obviously the solution is more guns
__label__1	Obviously ~~Jesus~~ Trump doesnt have to attend because he is chosen by God!
__label__-1	Women are generally on the right side of history
__label__1	Oh joy, it's been a while since I've had a good ole election day disappointment.
__label__-1	Between this exclusive, and the WaPo Carter Page exclusive, this has been a real bad news hour for the Trump administration and its GOP enablers.
__label__-1	Let's start with every elected white house official
__label__-1	Ron Howard VO: He was.
__label__1	Was it written in crayon, by a man with tiny hands?
__label__-1	As they should be .
__label__-1	"""Loaned"""
__label__1	lol sure glad we didn't get that ~~war hawk~~ ~~globalist~~ Wall Street sell-out Hitlery!
__label__-1	Shit, Trump was eating chocolate cake again.
__label__1	Obama made him do it
__label__-1	How so?
__label__-1	Our taxes prove that we are not being paid to protest his orange, obese ass.
__label__-1	Why is this news?
__label__1	Their slow deaths will make America great again
__label__-1	Is anyone besides the MSM and his brain addled followers praising him?
__label__-1	Sad!
__label__1	Gosh, that secret Muslim terrorist born in Kenya &amp; his nutrition nazi wife really ruined the spirit of Easter, didn't they?
__label__1	No, God did that.
__label__-1	It is not soon enough.
__label__1	Mexico is going to struggle to pay for that!
__label__-1	He might be capable of only leering, that part might not be his fault.
__label__1	Why should I care what doctors want when I can care about the opinion of insurance lobbyists?
__label__-1	If Fox News says it, the opposite is true, keep resisting!
__label__1	Shows what you know, Kenya is in Africa!
__label__1	He can't create the report while he is being audited.
__label__1	Truly: a meeting of our greatest minds.
__label__-1	Yes.
__label__-1	Potential?
__label__-1	What better place to hide it in plain sight than the hands of our enemies?
__label__-1	"That's a poll of 677 registered voters... I would hardly say we can make claims of ""nearly half of Americans"" with such a small sample size as they can be very misleading"
__label__1	I'm shocked!
__label__1	"More ""fake news""."
__label__1	Shocking.
__label__-1	It's almost like the whole Trump-Russia thing is hot bologna.
__label__1	Duh, why would they need to set aside any funding when Mexico's going to pay for it?
__label__-1	So, clueless about this next impending disaster too.
__label__-1	Disappointing.
__label__1	that is an estimated amount, I'm sure his criminal organization will hand over all their assets, let's send Crux down to collect.
__label__1	Yeah, Canada that notorious threat to the worlds
__label__-1	He seems intent on making America a dictatorship.. I'm not sure if it's because he wants to be a dictator, or because he's a spoiled child who just wants to get his own way.
__label__1	You miss 100% of the shots you don't take!
__label__1	You mean working for a living, who knew?
__label__-1	Funniest thing is that this guy wasn't even expecting to win and the dems couldn't find someone to beat him.
__label__1	Easier to cut jobs that haven't been filled I guess
__label__1	Of course everyone knows being poor means god hates you
__label__-1	Well there's Democrats, third party voters, and 4% of Republicans.
__label__-1	What a fucking dumbuck... america is doomed if he isn't going to be impeached.
__label__-1	That sounds legal
__label__-1	Fucking propaganda lol
__label__-1	I raffle, I ruse?
__label__1	I'd say that Mac on the podium is an evil idol
__label__1	All we need is this one last hit, then we can quit.
__label__-1	AWWW YEAHHH I LOVE BEING FROM TEXAS WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK
__label__1	So when do we invade Iran?
__label__-1	Maybe a stupid question: Have we seen Obama's tax returns?
__label__1	They are just putting all those subsidies to good use
__label__1	Maybe she'll move out of the country.
__label__-1	They've essentially looted the entire country
__label__-1	The next thing you now we will have a corporate theocrat in the white house and a massive homeland attack.
__label__-1	If the clueless idiots running John McCain's presidential campaign had bothered to do their homework before thrusting this moron into the public spotlight, we wouldn't be making her rich and acting like anything she has to say is worth the time to listen.
__label__-1	Add Lafourche Parish to the list of places I never want to live.
__label__-1	Where are all the moral crusaders taking a dump on the poor who took advantage of poor Wal Mart with the EBT computer glitch during the shutdown?
__label__-1	Democrats to open office of personnel to constantly ask Rand Paul whether he thinks private businesses should be able to discriminate against blacks.
__label__1	That's why we revolted, 'Murica!
__label__1	So has the war against poverty and we keep giving the poor cash.
__label__-1	Why hasn't he resigned?
__label__1	God damn these women and their sex-having!
__label__-1	Nope.
__label__1	It would be amusing to also apply to all government workers, being that they are paid with tax payer money and that is the real issue here, isn't it?
__label__1	I'm sure that crashing the global economy, using taxpayer money to bail out the rich, and papering over the financial collapse with zero interest rates and quantitative easing had *nothing* to do with this.
__label__-1	One thing I can agree with Ron Paul on.
__label__-1	Did any of us expect Sanders to win the South?
__label__-1	Truuuu
__label__-1	Well, when you have some liberals salivating about nominating a liberal judge and overturning all the 5 - 4 gun laws, you can see why some people want to block Obama from doing that.
__label__-1	I love sanders and everything he believes in but I think his policy's won't make it into or out of congress.
__label__1	Rubio = TPP and Gang of 8....yeah REAL conservatism
__label__1	But he can still get the nomination!
__label__-1	Yeah, fuck this.
__label__1	Yes, please make public universities as successful as public high schools.
__label__1	Wow, when I was 8i didn't understand anything about politics.. good for this kid to not be influenced by their parents
__label__-1	America's best and brightest were definitely not in that stream of Trump supporters.
__label__-1	This implied threat is exactly the reason why people more prone to violence from all sides will be more likely to be drawn to Trump rallies.
__label__-1	Yes.
__label__1	Yes, I'm sure a couple lame DDoS attempts on his website will completely dismantle him, just like tearing down campaign flyers dismantled campaigns before the Internet.
__label__1	Of course he feels this way, he's just glad he's alive
__label__-1	Ah the all important single issue Clay Aiken vote...
__label__1	Because the second most favored candidate amongst black voters is Donald Trump
__label__1	oh no what a shame we really needed another boring debate
__label__1	But I heard he's the most antigun human to ever walk the earth
__label__1	Come on now, what are you gonna do, declare war on another country and NOT upgrade your nuclear arsenal?
__label__1	What does this have to do with Bernie Sanders?
__label__1	We were told that he is a far left ideologue, shocked that he's not.
__label__-1	He should have said, couldn't.
__label__1	Oh sure, cause god forbid our politicians don't jump when Israel asks.
__label__-1	"If dems weren't harsh on gun stuff I wonder what McConnell would have replaced "" NRA Approval"" with?"
__label__-1	Yay warcrimes!
__label__1	Yeah cause Syria was such great work
__label__1	What could possibly go wrong?
__label__-1	There have been very few if any.
__label__-1	"In the related news, Donald Trump ruled out releasing the exact measurements of his dick only saying that ""I guarantee there is no problem, OK?"""
__label__1	Surely the cost of living wont go up?
__label__-1	Clinton has been asking to be interviewed for months now.
__label__1	Well, $500 tickets weren't costly enough to keep out the super predators.
__label__1	"That's because females under 65 are ""BernieBros"""
__label__1	Karl Marx died in 1883.
__label__1	let me think how did it go for the last blue eyed blond hair person to blame there problems on a Jewish person
__label__1	Seizing dividends is a great idea to stabilize the market.
__label__-1	To be fair if we are not going to call the sunsetting of the Bush tax cuts an increase, then why should we call this temporary reduction sunsetting an increase?
__label__1	Wisconsin Republicans on the other hand, keep the hell away from the ballots!
__label__1	Oooo, I love political articles where the author knows zilch about the politics they are discussing.
__label__1	See, the rich ARE job creators.
__label__-1	What goes around comes around.
__label__-1	I'll take his job and salary if he doesn't want it, that is a lot of money imo
__label__-1	When are the Republicans going to be charged for being the nation's largest orgainized crime group?
__label__-1	Annnd he could have bought insurance beforehand instead of having the choice between between getting rescued or bankrupt.
__label__-1	Poor Al....nobody outside of the hardcore HuffPo crowd takes him seriously anymore....
__label__1	No shit .. really?
__label__1	It's their own fault for being lazy Takers, they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and turn themselves into Makers!
__label__1	It's a good thing then that existing laws don't expire or we would be completely lawless!
__label__1	Obviously he just wants to prevent the children from becoming dependents and learn to pull themselves up by their bootstraps so that they can buy their own Christmas Gifts.
__label__1	They must have worked really really hard.
__label__1	cause if it ain't white and christian it just ain't right ya'll
__label__1	I feel safer now
__label__1	Obviously, we should impeach him.
__label__1	That will certainly help them in elections.
__label__-1	"Followed by the ""Jesus Hold My Beer Act""."
__label__-1	Dammit South Dakota, this is why no one likes us.
__label__-1	The first one being Jeb Bush campaigning for president.
__label__-1	Why do we not have some qualifications to run for President?
__label__-1	I'm glad she's brave enough to speak for the middleclass, but I have my reservations something *meaningful* will come of it.
__label__-1	Good God I hope they live in the south.
__label__1	Someone should ask Judge Judy what she thinks.
__label__1	Don't deny the Queen her rightful throne!
__label__-1	NOPE!
__label__1	She's just another uninformed bernie bro.
__label__1	Oh look at Bernie discovering issues about a state he doesn't already live in, how cute
__label__1	Nice job guys, real awesome revolution youre starting here.
__label__-1	What a hack.
__label__1	How dare the government doesn't have the right to restrict political videos from being aired!
__label__-1	Who's paying them?
__label__1	He's not a Jew, he's a Muslim-lover!
__label__-1	Damn, do they have any more adjectives for the title?
__label__-1	If only there were two Hillarys to split the vote.
__label__1	Relevant article, credible news source
__label__1	This is so sexist
__label__1	Well, at least Hillary's Wall Street speeches are now publicly available.
__label__1	Ya; because 2015 will be the year that Scrooge McBernie spent raking in millions from lobbyists, creating offshore shell companies and lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills.
__label__-1	Oh dear God... it gets worse: Multiple souces confirm cars may have also been involved in the trip.
__label__-1	Banjo sales through the roof!
__label__-1	The kind of guts it takes to be a president.
__label__-1	So make it illegal.
__label__1	Well, Duh, Obama is pretty hard right!
__label__-1	Drumpf is big government of a different variety, though.
__label__1	Well it looks like another failed attempt at socialism... Maybe if you try it in America it will work better
__label__1	Really, this should have been an obvious win given how New York is a southern state.
__label__1	and i'm sure it was fair and square
__label__1	It's over guys, wrap it up and kneel before the queen.
__label__1	Thanks for waiting until after New York to say this
__label__1	But only people who aren't employed and are looking for free handouts support Bernie.
__label__1	Guns keep America safe once again.
__label__1	I look forward to our first Native American Vice President!
__label__1	North Carolina seems to have its priorities right
__label__1	sounds like a good excuse for more GOP tax cuts!
__label__1	The calendar is favorable to sanders though
__label__-1	Palin, Stalin whats the difference.
__label__-1	How so?
__label__-1	"Al Qadea were guests of the Taliban, by Islamic tradition and Afghani tribal tradition they couldn't just ""offer"" Bin Laden to the US Government."
__label__-1	perfect, you can buy a car and drive over the border into canada and hopefully theyll give you health care
__label__-1	Four years later and we still hear from Palin at least once a week.
__label__1	Quality journalism.
__label__1	That's the tipe of aducation them get at their estate label, Lol
__label__-1	you lost the election, give it up
__label__-1	I'm going to miss Allen, but at least we still have Michele Bachmann to laugh at.
__label__1	They should feel honored to be burned to death making cheap shit to be sold by the great Walmart corporation!
__label__-1	Considering his terrible record of prosecuting people leaking info this is interesting.
__label__-1	Especially the 40% that pay no taxes.
__label__1	Privatizing education is a GREAT idea!
__label__-1	Police departments get paid by arrests?
__label__-1	They created a bunch of code words associated with the bikini bridgegate, so that they could talk about something important but non-public that happened last week.
__label__-1	giving the republican party OR the democrat party the power over government policy guarantees more stupidity, wars, exploitation and oppression
__label__1	Yeah because *foster care* will be a better environment for these kids to grow up in than one in which their parents let them walk home from a park alone.
__label__-1	Thanks Obama
__label__1	"It's just what the ""market"" demands to retain their ""talent""."
__label__1	ITT: Dumbass ANTI-WAR HIPPY WIMPS forgetting about the SLUMBERING THREAT of WARSAW PACT ARMOUR in the case of a CENTRAL EUROPEAN INVASION!
__label__1	Yea the solution to corruption in politics is to reduce free speech.
__label__1	He's whitish so it's okay.
__label__-1	You would think for $1.5 million that you can get something better.
__label__-1	If it ain't broke don't fix it...oh wait
__label__-1	Reince is very much a 'fall in line' kinda guy.
__label__1	If one of Donald's wives cheated on him, I'm sure he would be really nice to the other guy.
__label__1	I'm sure that this had nothing to do with religion.
__label__-1	Irrelevant until after the conventions.
__label__1	You can always trust rabidly right wing outlets to accurately paraphrase President Obama's speeches.
__label__-1	Trump is Han Solo
__label__-1	Pivoting away from his base.. Fuck em
__label__1	That doesn't seem like a loaded question that's attempting to make Trump racist at all.
__label__1	Who wants women to suffer?
__label__-1	We get it!
__label__-1	She's merely reaching out to the people she wants to help her shape the future of America, for all people... as long as those people have lots of money.
__label__1	I'll be wearing my ceremonial tarp in solidarity.
__label__1	Probably outdated information.
__label__1	"I heard the aide said ""I don't recall,"" some 42 times and is being held in contempt"
__label__1	That's why so few members of Congress are rich, right?
__label__-1	But, why?
__label__-1	Only in a left leaning media can speaking poorly against your own self interest and in the interest of the working class be considered a negative.....and theres people that nod their head when dumb shit like this is said?
__label__-1	Thankfully, Bernie's spoiled supporters have parents with money.
__label__1	I'm sure Hillary would be more than willing to look into it and address the matter in an open and transparent fashion
__label__1	Yep, this is the behavior of people I want deciding my country's future.
__label__1	The concern that Breitbart has for members of the Democratic Party running for office is truly touching.
__label__1	This is absolutely explosive and devastating!
__label__1	Because the system is rigged, of course
__label__1	But he has $10 BILLION dollars!
__label__1	Ok Hillary, who made a promise that she will debate Bernie before Califronia rejects the debate now and that is fine, but the Republican Nominee should accept the Fox News debate and debate the 2nd place person in historic fashion instead or he is a chicken!
__label__-1	"Bernie ""I will not run a negative campaign"" sure seems negative lately"
__label__-1	Too bad, Peter Schiff seems like a pretty smart guy.
__label__-1	Hate + Ignorance = Right wing talk radio
__label__1	Must be Bush.
__label__1	Yes please more deficit spending
__label__1	Just what we need, more people in prison.
__label__-1	And this is why the militarization of cops is so terrifying.
__label__-1	Interesting take on the issue.
__label__-1	this is just more guns being added to the problem:(
__label__1	I'm sure nothing will go wrong here.
__label__-1	ELI5?
__label__-1	Doesn't make her less of a liar, child-abandoning, self-aggrandizing, money grubbing whore.
__label__1	Oh, you have it wrong, New York Times, if you are a worker you must be punished for it, low pay, poor housing, no health care, if you are a worker, it is your own fault.
__label__-1	Gonna need them guns when Kansas finishes imploding on itself
__label__1	They trade lobster and filet mignon for hooch and crack cocaine!
__label__1	Well shit, this just cost her the election.
__label__1	Well that's why we need stronger voter ID laws, to make sure all these illegal immigrants aren't casting ballots for the Democrats!
__label__1	At an average age of 75, it probably won't.
__label__-1	And people wonder why wikileaks was necessary... and why Julian Assange is a virtual prisoner right now.
__label__1	And this (just like people who loudly pray in public) is the mark of a true patriot
__label__1	WaPo is in the tank for Trump
__label__-1	World Nut Daily
__label__1	To be fair, it was a community college.
__label__1	Hillary is pro-net neutrality.
__label__-1	Bill Clinton came to PR the week before the party cut the number of polling places ...
__label__-1	"""We're protesting because Trump and his supporters are violent bigots spreading a hateful message!"""
__label__-1	The Blacks love him.
__label__-1	No, they're just donating to charity because they think the Clinton's hold the best charity... Alright guys, I need a new script, I don't think this is gonna cut it.
__label__-1	Did you also learn that these super delegates were bought and paid for months ago?
__label__1	So I guess 2 Guys = Some of Bernie's Supports
__label__-1	He's gonna put gold trim on it and put a fountain in front.
__label__-1	But seriously, this is great.
__label__1	Yeah i bet you're right
__label__1	What a great link that makes this exact argument
__label__-1	They dont support him for his views, they support him so they can spew their racists views.
__label__1	Wow, Trump is starting to look like a real politician...
__label__1	Hey at least it's better than crooked Hillary
__label__-1	She didn't she sold the thing she promised long ago.
__label__1	Really bringing out the big guns today aren't we guys
__label__1	What an SJW
__label__-1	What a shitty headline, in other news: I did not like fish, until I did
__label__1	What could possibly go wrong with this brilliant scheme?
__label__1	Yeah, owners fault for not planning for a mass shooting at their club..
__label__-1	Im pretty sure bernies campaign warned twice that the dnc database had vulnerabilities, but they refused to do anything and tried to oust bernie for cheating.
__label__1	Yeah, because everything happens in its own individual bubble.
__label__1	Because the best time to pass laws is always after a tragic event, when everybody is thinking clearly
__label__1	Right he just has to wait for Shillary to be arrested for murder or whatever and he will be in the White House.
__label__-1	"That red conditional formatting for ""outstanding donations"" is pretty bad"
__label__-1	the senators in this photo did not vote down this proposal.
__label__1	Some hard hitting journalism right here
__label__-1	I really thought it would be crazy to pick Warren as VP but the media is really trying to make it look like thats whats going to happen.
__label__-1	Didn't he have 8 years to do that?
__label__1	Shocking
__label__1	How very tolerant of them.
__label__1	But the media told me Obamacare was a big success!
__label__1	"Yeah, cause ""trickle down"" economics was such a huge success"
__label__-1	I hate TPP as much as the next guy, but this kind of rhetoric is just insane!
__label__1	"As any good constitutional originalist will tell you, the founders didn't really mean ""well regulated"", and the amendment is up for interpretation."
__label__-1	Hopefully they don't give us a president Trump.
__label__1	Having shootouts in night clubs is preferable to having basic gun laws
__label__-1	Pro Tip: Choose PPO over HMO if you have any choice in the matter.
__label__1	but we pay for it and it is a capitalist venture, so it is an American good death right?
__label__1	Bank of America to charge $5 per month fee to non-customers for prospective account placeholder maintenance.
__label__-1	He better hope no one was reading his lips.
__label__-1	...what a fascist
__label__1	Yes, guns are the reason Detroit is a cesspool resembling a 3rd world country.
__label__1	People who don't have jobs aren't people; problem solved.
__label__-1	they should have done it before they had kids
__label__-1	Of course he means, dehumanized, not deprogrammed.
__label__1	because there aren't millions of pot smokers already
__label__-1	Last time it was to make Obama a one term president, and we see how well they did there.
__label__1	Plus, 60 Minutes didn't grill Obama about the super-long-form birth certificate that **still** hasn't been released.
__label__1	Your Tax Dollars at Work
__label__1	Gasoline combustion engine
__label__1	Well duh, you have to know a black person to get close enough to them
__label__-1	I thought you could just pray that away.
__label__1	Yeah, but most of them are living large and own things like refrigerator and have running water, so they just need to stop whining like poor little children.
__label__1	"One of the interns wrote ""legalize weed"" wrong on accident and now we're here"
__label__-1	Yeah, and the financial crisis he inherited from Bush is Obama's fault as well... Or we can blame W. for the shit W. did.
__label__1	Well, at least Josh Duggar isn't gay because that would be unforgiveable!
__label__-1	While we're at it, let's prohibit the fossil fuel industry from obtaining tax subsidies/rebates.
__label__-1	I didn't no my dick could get so hard
__label__1	At this point, what difference does it make?
__label__-1	Please provide a link, as far as I can tell there's nothing in the ACA (Obamacare) about single-payer.
__label__1	But that one R-Asmussen poll says that Trump is going to win in a landslide just like Romney did!
__label__1	White Christians are oppressed in America
__label__-1	"After reading the article I still feel there is only one canidate that does ""place America before any personal ambitions"" and his name is Bernie!"

__label__1	But I was told Trump has already won the election!
__label__1	it's funny because i'm 12 and dicks are funney
__label__-1	I'm gonna hold off on deciding whether I favor this until I hear what Trump has to say.
__label__1	Just more 5D chess He's gonna act like a complete idiot up until the debates then, BAM, go full college professor with his responses!
__label__-1	Why?
__label__-1	They're going to have to have Ailes' office steam-cleaned.
__label__-1	Of course he does.. he's a Racist.
__label__1	Damn what a shame that would be
__label__1	The donation to her campaign came AFTER she dropped the charges so its legit...... silly liberals.
__label__-1	Funny because I read his quoted remarks and they're about culture, not whiteness.
__label__1	Oh yes, politifact presenting the information without bias
__label__-1	Everyone in the GOP hates everyone else in the GOP.
__label__-1	Why is this a bad choice?
__label__-1	hope blm looks after the hellary convention security details.
__label__-1	I'll never trust the Zodiac Killer El Rato.
__label__1	He's obviously a southern state
__label__1	Democratic voter suppression!
__label__1	This Clinton lady sounds like a real class act
__label__-1	This particular email deserves its own thread.
__label__1	Seems legit.
__label__-1	Michelle Obama was quite upset that she had to cancel the WWE-style entrance after last week's RNC.
__label__-1	So democrats aren't fear-mongering about trump?
__label__-1	They're not.
__label__-1	If they attacked christian,they wouldn't give a shit.
__label__1	So glad my daughter will have this inspiring role model to look up to.
__label__-1	I read the headline and honestly didn't know which position she would be flipping from.
__label__-1	He also ate a girl out in the Oval Office.
__label__-1	Tim Kaine was a big fat mistake.
__label__-1	The convention is literally a celebration of her, who else would they choose to end it?
__label__1	But... but... they hied actors to fill the seats
__label__-1	Hillary's running as a democrat though
__label__1	What a trooper.
__label__-1	How many delegates at the RNC are lobbyists?
__label__1	This is the person we want holding the nuclear launch codes.
__label__1	It touches my heart to learn how deeply concerned The American Conservative is with the well being of the Left.
__label__1	Game changer
__label__1	Let's ban all violent video games That will get the youth right?
__label__-1	Trump doesn't need their money.
__label__1	Duh, the Jews have all the $$
__label__-1	Perhaps SOPA was the distraction so that we wouldn't notice this passing.
__label__-1	Ironically it's the same God
__label__1	This must be fake, congress has never done anything immoral or wrong.
__label__-1	Silly, you're supposed to shoot your pew pew at the paper men, not the meat-bags.
__label__1	Corporations are people, my friend, but teachers and firefighters are not.
__label__1	Yeah, that'll work.
__label__1	Clearly he didn't cut enough of the budget.
__label__-1	I am seriously considering a run for sheriff of LA county next term.
__label__-1	Truly a well known and respected information outlet.
__label__1	Much better to keep the lowest earners below the poverty line to make sure it's convenient for the rest of us amirite?
__label__-1	If only there was another way to enact meaningful change in our nations laws!
__label__1	"Weell, the Jews *do* call themselves ""The Chosen People"""
__label__1	The leader of the party with big ideas!
__label__1	So difficult to imagine a Republican lying about the ACA.
__label__1	I'm sure the politicians won't have any problem turning down more money when they realize the people want them to.
__label__1	As a director of Halliburton at the time, it would be a breach of Cheney's fiduciary duty not to.
__label__1	I was always taught that being Mississippi was illegal.
__label__-1	That may be the only thing that would stop it.
__label__-1	What a dumbass
__label__-1	Now you can blame congress if you are accused of date rape.
__label__-1	UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
__label__1	Why do you hate their freedom to be ultragigahyper wealthy?
__label__-1	Clearly the team owner contributed more to Walker's campaign than the university.
__label__-1	Bobby Jindal - Stuck on stupid.
__label__1	Well, those elderly people probably went through the Great Depression, so they already got some practice!
__label__-1	Snarky comment: There's no such thing as a simple tax return.
__label__1	Corporations are people though
__label__1	whoa, what party?
__label__-1	'Illegal aliens never break any laws' - enlightened leftist
__label__-1	He's not even president yet and he is already creating jobs!
__label__1	definitely atheism.
__label__1	What better way to prove that we need healthcare reform than by putting tons of people in the hospital?
__label__1	Because he's honest, and is a straight shooter!
__label__-1	Damn dude you are spamming this page right now lol
__label__-1	This Khan thing sure has worked out great for Trump, keep fucking that chicken!
__label__-1	I'm thankful for his son's service.
__label__-1	Hillary Clinton and Obama were also responsible for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which occurred before either of them were born.
__label__1	But liberals are the REAL racists!
__label__-1	Are people seriously not understanding that when Donald Trump says immigrants/undocumented works, what he really means is Muslims and Mexicans?
__label__-1	Her internal polling must be looking pretty terrible, finally
__label__-1	The primaries were
__label__1	He's one of the good ones!
__label__-1	I mean he's not wrong
__label__-1	I would think we'd want to keep the federal government away from federal elections as much as possible.
__label__1	I do so enjoy watching my generation be the whipping boy for the media and American politics.
__label__-1	Liberal shill....oh wait
__label__-1	I would love for this creepy little man to stay out of my uterus.
__label__-1	Far cry from the 'Trump will rip Hillary apart in the debates' attitude of just a couple months ago
__label__1	This article is misleading because Trump said they founded ISIS, not ISIL.
__label__1	Hey now you can't call him a fascist until he kills at least 15000 people and then mayyybe we can use that word
__label__1	Of course there is, he paid his employees and they paid for child care.
__label__1	Did she mentioned how is she paying the $hills on reddit?
__label__-1	Remember that time she lied to you
__label__-1	the times should preempt cheeto and stop covering his loser rallies
__label__-1	It's sad what the GOPpers are doing to them.
__label__-1	They have keep a record of every person who received a haircut for 20 years and/or turn that record over to the ATF when they close their business?
__label__1	Maybe he could ask Obama to disband it.
__label__-1	How did Clinton spin accepting donations from Russia while selling Uranium mines to a state owned firm named ARMZ.
__label__-1	...and people believed him.
__label__-1	Nah, he's just gonna live tweet the entire briefing.
__label__-1	just stopped in to say Fuck Chris Christie...
__label__-1	No takesies backsies.
__label__-1	Political prosecution at it's finest.
__label__-1	"The key word here is ""if""."
__label__-1	Does it have anything to do with the anti-semite that is in charge of his campaign?
__label__-1	better let the women kill their own babies
__label__1	Another unbiased, reputable source.
__label__-1	The gang's all here.
__label__1	Don't worry, he's winning
__label__1	But I was just in VA and saw *so many* Trump signs!
__label__-1	any chance the Clinton's have more money than Trump?
__label__1	But all polls are skewed and rigged except that one poll from the LA times!
__label__1	Too bad we don't have any tape of all the crazy shit he's been saying for the past two years.
__label__-1	Hillary Clinton will withstand these baseless accusations, the same way she withstood manufactured scandals from Republicans for over 25 years
__label__-1	Says who?
__label__-1	I guess he doesn't want any votes then.
__label__-1	Nothing says smaller government like more taxes!
__label__-1	This will definitely convince all of Rush Limbaugh's audience not to vote for Clinton, I'm sure at least 50% of them were planning on doing so.
__label__1	She's not a racist, she's a 'racial realist' I mean, *is she wrong*?
__label__-1	Not enough damage from what I can see.
__label__-1	Who's going to scoop up this steaming pile?
__label__1	Buying politicians cheaply is a form of free speech!
__label__1	allen west is the expert on race issues who will definitely help make things better!
__label__1	But but but....I thought she said she didn't delete any work related emails!
__label__-1	Add prisons to that list.
__label__1	Yeah, if you get raped, you're weak and don't deserve to be welcomed into the future of this nation!
__label__-1	Thanks Kasich
__label__-1	Holy mother of sweet baby Jesus, Scalia's passing saved Democracy in NC.
__label__1	I'm sure the DOJ will go after them right after they finish with the bankers.
__label__1	Isn't capitalism great?
__label__1	Clearly this is part of Obama's socialist agenda
__label__1	Impossible, they are pushing a drone fuelled police state!
__label__-1	SMH #WhereisObamaof2007?
__label__1	Obviously if Jesus was a counselor he would send all of the LGBT, sexually active students and jews to hell.
__label__-1	Finally, somebody willing to stand up to all those women in poverty!
__label__-1	Affordable Healthcare payed keeps the coat hangers away!
__label__1	I am sure the daily caller had nothing to do with it
__label__-1	Spoiler alert, she's getting elected.
__label__-1	The word 'formality' comes to mind.
__label__1	But the GOP isn't racist!
__label__1	Considering I have to pay extra for my luggage, it's nice that they don't charge me for the molestation.
__label__1	Unlike for-profit healthcare with a 40 year record of *always* putting the needs of patients first.
__label__1	...but fuck the unemployed, they're just lazy people who want unearned money!
__label__1	Because the LAPD is well known for their level of discretion.
__label__1	It was such a wholesome flag before it was hijacked
__label__1	They just need to man up and pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
__label__-1	Why are conservatives so fiscally irresponsible?
__label__1	Something something lame duck president.
__label__1	Yes, Trump has revealed the hidden racism in the republican base
__label__1	They could disrupt the stability that the US and her allies have brought to the region.
__label__-1	i eagerly await Huckabee's plans to send out troops to Red Lobster to prevent people from eating shellfish and to clothing stores to prevent people from wearing clothes of mixed fabrics.
__label__1	Totally not a perfect example of the racism inherent in the trump movement that makes ethnic minorities think that other candidates are a better path for America
__label__1	Yeah, I'm sure he would have
__label__-1	blame her lawyer.
__label__1	I'm sure they've both deleted some emails, so we can assume there is proof in there.
__label__-1	I would take Trump any day over that corrupt cow.
__label__-1	Quick, somebody please correct the record
__label__-1	How very sharia of you Donald
__label__-1	For fucks sake, why is this even a thing?
__label__1	Because that's logical and not completely batshit.
__label__-1	Machine says no
__label__-1	All doctor's statements are just campaign PR.
__label__1	That's out of context!
__label__-1	'You know what us southern boys really mean when we say make America great again?'
__label__-1	Florida man is slacking off.
__label__1	That's so weird, given her track record of total honesty and transparency
__label__-1	Thanks Obama!
__label__1	The economy is being rigged to make Obama look good.
__label__1	Yes, because Sanders is very popular outside of the OWS crowd.
__label__-1	71 percent liked, sounds about right.
__label__-1	The Ap
__label__1	but Hillary only wants 12 bucks for the minimum wage, she is a republican, I'm going to vote Johnson, he is closer to Bernie in all policies
__label__-1	Now I'm just wondering whom he intends to shoot in the face.
__label__-1	federal employees breaking federal law.
__label__-1	These cops should be punished with paid vacation and transfers to another precinct!
__label__1	Polls are now fake again.
__label__-1	So then Trump right in saying that Blacks are worse off now than at any time in recent memory.
__label__-1	Mostly I'm just surprised to learn that I wasn't the only Jewish gop donor
__label__1	Ah, the polls have gone from trustworthy back to skewed in favor of Clinton I see
__label__-1	So out of convenience, not conviction.
__label__-1	So does Hillary.
__label__-1	And the smears start.
__label__-1	Yeah jus one of a million reasons not to vote for this conman!
__label__1	Of course not, because it makes him uncomfortable when he's made aware of his privilege, and that's the *real racism*.
__label__-1	Did they have Anthony Weiner and Bill pick the girls?
__label__1	So the electorate can make well informed decisions.
__label__1	when she leaves the WH next time, she'll be able to buy Chappaqua.
__label__1	I'm sure undecided women voters will be very impressed by this.
__label__1	Dat post truth politics!
__label__-1	Mainly George Soros and Jim Simons.
__label__-1	It just got ten feet taller!
__label__1	Ya, but both candidates are the same!
__label__1	"How very ""presidential"" of him."
__label__-1	as in 'holding back' his tears.
__label__1	Double-down on the personal attacks, I'm sure that'll work for ya.
__label__1	Wrong!
__label__-1	Wish she had been hillarys VP pick.
__label__1	Strip clubs don't have ugly employees and I don't see have anyone complaining.
__label__1	Short term solutions is what's best for our future!
__label__-1	It's funny how people are taking republican endorsements as if they're a good thing.
__label__1	To be fair, if these employees didn't follow company culture, none of these problems would have happened
__label__-1	If Hillary was accused of the exact same thing they would line up to investigate.
__label__1	Cant we fix this with a taco bowl?
__label__-1	It's amazing that people will continually vote for a party that is *ready and willing* to kowtow to an interest group that is holding the needs of an entire nation hostage.
__label__-1	If you think that's what happened, you need to start reading beyond headlines.
__label__-1	It's a shame he doesn't support net neutrality
__label__-1	Men are actually more emotional than women.
__label__1	Wait... they left out Ron Paul.
__label__-1	The product of a welfare state?
__label__1	What a surprise!
__label__-1	Do they even listen to themselves when they say these things?
__label__1	Because as we all know, gender is a choice.
__label__1	Now now, corporations are job creators so if you do background checks(audits) before giving them tax benefits and subsidies, they'd get offended and stop hiring.
__label__1	Yes, America is so third world.
__label__1	This has democratic party written all over it.
__label__-1	Nice job editorializing the title of the link.
__label__1	Right, because children are only cash cows for the state.
__label__-1	"To go along with the ""Cornhusker Kickback"" and the ""Louisiana Purchase"" in the effort to *pass* Obamacare."
__label__1	Love those entitlements.
__label__-1	John ..... It's time you retired
__label__1	Yeah, like DOMA
__label__-1	Glenn Beck is still alive?
__label__1	No need to worry, they're building a new hockey stadium that will take care of everything.
__label__-1	Planned parenthood should give thanks, publicly with quotes, videos, and images of any evidence they have of this.
__label__-1	he does, every 15 minutes
__label__-1	This says a lot about our shit courts.
__label__-1	Idiots.
__label__1	Just remember kids, Bernie has no chance of winning anything, pack it up and forget about it, he's got no chance, she's the frontrunner, and there's just no chance.
__label__1	Obviously Hitlerally bribed him and this means nothing in regards to her candidacy!
__label__-1	That's because animals and the environment aren't campaign contributors
__label__-1	I don't remember, what was the deal with the emails again?
__label__-1	I have said from the beginning that Ted Cruz is actually running for vice president or a cabinet position.
__label__1	DAT SASS
__label__1	But how will our Congressmen support themselves after they've served their country with such dignity and honor?
__label__1	Yes let's cut off diplomatic ties to a nation of 1 Billion that largely influences the global market....solid idea
__label__1	So, he wants to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which would revoke his citizenship, which would make him ineligible for President, which means he can't sign the law revoking his citizenship.... IT NEVER ENDS.
__label__-1	Has anyone heard Trump say something nice about a woman he doesn't want to have sex with?
__label__-1	"The old ""anyone who criticizes Trump is a Shillary"" argument."
__label__1	My people are being treated like our brothers before us, one taco truck for every 3 Mexicans
__label__-1	\#WeMatter
__label__1	actually being progressive
__label__-1	I hear their family tree doesn't fork either.
__label__1	It's cool, Trump has assured us his base loves his strategy.
__label__-1	Sad when the aging and demented lashes out... Think your punching days are long gone tough guy.
__label__-1	But he still thinks the asshole will make a great President.
__label__1	Didn't know locker room banter also included talking about one's daughter like that.
__label__1	Oh so Glenn Beck's opinion is suddenly valid among liberal circles?
__label__-1	"I'll take ""things everyone saw coming for $500"""
__label__1	Despite Bernie's multiple affairs and history of bragging about sexual assault, like all guys do?
__label__1	what I like most about trump is his overweening sense of humility and modesty.
__label__1	Yeah, save the pussy-grabbing comments for the ACTUAL locker room!
__label__1	Thats right Trump supporters, go and vote November 28!
__label__-1	Isn't she a Christian?
__label__1	This is much more important than giving me my $27 back.
__label__1	But he was a Democrat then
__label__1	Now *that* is truly presidential behavior!
__label__1	I don't trust the nose of a demon to detect his own odor.
__label__1	I thought FEMA already built those for us?
__label__-1	its takes a pussy grabber to know a pussy grabber.
__label__-1	Knew that was coming.
__label__-1	Nah, we have Mohametan to fall back on, first.
__label__1	Shocking that an Abrahamic religion has been in America since George Washington
__label__-1	Alex Jones influence was a lot stronger than i thought it would be.
__label__-1	Because that's what is happening.
__label__-1	Usually an unimpeachable source is the person who started the rumor in the first place.
__label__1	I'm not a racist!
__label__-1	I mean... He is.
__label__-1	False flag.
__label__-1	pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
__label__1	Great ground game
__label__1	I wonder why?
__label__1	I'm sure it has nothing at all to do with money.
__label__1	Didn't Obama take all their guns?
__label__1	and here i was thinking places like the red pill were filled with alpha males
__label__1	Hey Donald, you should totally respond to this
__label__-1	All of America.
__label__1	See, the blacks love him!
__label__-1	"Hillary in 2013: ""Marriage is between a man and a woman"""
__label__1	Clearly they were Clinton plants who were pretending to be white supremacists
__label__1	You're dad doesn't care what you think, woman
__label__1	Segregation Now!
__label__1	Did you know that sometimes aborted babies are pushed back into the womb just so they can be aborted again?
__label__1	Part of the conspiracy obviously.
__label__1	To think that Hillary had a plant this deep into his campaign this whole time.
__label__1	yes, she should stay behind the scenes and not make a sound unless asked like Melania
__label__1	But...but...poor people are welfare dependent and they have all the time in the world!
__label__-1	So we finally get people to largely stop smoking cigarettes and now we want them to smoke weed?
__label__1	Im pretty sure i saw her blinking SOS.
__label__1	We all know that underinflated footballs are a much bigger threat to the integrity of the game than players who beat their wives and girlfriends.
__label__-1	"If we played the ""flip-flop"" game on both of these candidates they would both earn medals."
__label__-1	Hillary Clinton had 30 years to make it impossible for him to commit insurance fraud.
__label__-1	Obama should be given another Nobel prize just for how much he makes Republicans fume.
__label__-1	Trump has abnormal big mouth movements...what's your point?
__label__1	This looks like a reputable source.
__label__1	BOMBSHELL, the night before her Birthday, WHO DOES THAT?
__label__1	[And Holden on Tuesday told POLITICO that the document shredding was unrelated to concerns about possible investigations from a Democratic Senate,] Um, yeah.
__label__-1	Honest question - Is there a statistic out there for those who get commuted sentences from Presidents who end up back in prison for re-offending?
__label__1	Oh no!
__label__1	Well, if MSNBC said it happened then it must be true.
__label__1	Another example of Trump supporters being oppressed.
__label__1	theeconomiccollapseblog Sounds like a very un-biased and relaible site
__label__-1	Nuclear winter.
__label__1	But the polls are tightening!
__label__1	Who the hell give you the right to judge Republicans by their actions?
__label__-1	I'm not American, but can't help liking Huckabee.
__label__-1	Jon Stewart, do your thing.
__label__-1	Don't forget about the **wars** going on in your name!
__label__-1	How long until he gets a presidential pardon?
__label__-1	Honestly, I have no problem with them writing off losses, but pay the fair amount on the profits too.
__label__-1	because the nuclear threat isn't working, damnit!
__label__1	But how can this be with 90% supporting background checks?
__label__-1	What was a homicide in 1993 isn't necessarily a homicide today
__label__-1	And that 6% are probably all drug war lobbyist and republicans.
__label__1	No worries, they won't go after wealthy women.
__label__1	"It's just like Jesus said, ""Blessed are the rich for they shall inherit EVERYTHING!!!!!"""
__label__-1	Good for Vermont.
__label__1	Wow who would have thought that when people have more money to spend that companies do better?
__label__-1	Should've stuck it to the bottom of a UPS truck.
__label__-1	I guess you just can't fix stupid.
__label__-1	They'll just buy more.
__label__1	Because she is the head of the DEMOCRATIC party of course!
__label__-1	82% of criminals view the police unfavorably.
__label__-1	Remember this guy WILL be the next President.
__label__1	Taking on the real issues
__label__1	Damn foreigners influencing our elections!
__label__-1	Aside from all this speech theories, doesn't anyone find it disrespectful how this played out?
__label__-1	Reinvade Iraq out of principle
__label__1	I'm looking forward to the flood of self-analysis and reflection among right wing talking heads as they try to understand how they could have been so wrong on something so big.
__label__-1	I am looking at the cartoon show, and let me tell you - Trump seems the reasonable one.
__label__-1	inb4 conservatives complain about people liking a soshulust that they can't call a muslim terrorist
__label__-1	Well, by that logic, Watergate was no reason to prosecute Nixon.
__label__1	We don't need no stinkin' separation of powers.
__label__1	We have a perfectly good narrative going on here, why would we want to sully it with facts?
__label__1	Yeah putting that poem on the statue of liberty seems sort of short sighted now.
__label__1	Good thing the Republicans are for following the law of the land, which is the Constitution and which specifically states about freedom of religion.
__label__1	Yeah, and men can't be feminists.
__label__1	Oh thank God...that shit was keeping me up at nights.
__label__1	Shocking.......... .. .. .. .. ..
__label__1	because they aren't successful in technology at all.
__label__-1	Coastlines have been changing for billions of years, the issues pointed out in this article would continue even if use of fossil fuels were to be completely eliminated.
__label__-1	Whelp Tumblr is now voting for Hillary X Huma
__label__1	Yup, don't worry about that pesky constitution, it only gets in the way of forcing your viewpoints upon the masses
__label__1	Maybe he just really really likes Lynyrd Skynyrd.
__label__-1	The compassionate right everyone.
__label__1	Guys.... The title is
__label__1	Totally not true until published by Huffpost or Vox.
__label__-1	He should tell the story of when his Dad shot JFK.
__label__-1	Thanks again Russian Hackers
__label__1	This just shows how good he is at business
__label__1	Will Donald Trump condemn the liberal animals for vandalizing a grave site?
__label__1	im sure the poor guy was suffering from a mental illness.
__label__1	1st amendment is overrated anyway.
__label__-1	Only if you live in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin.
__label__-1	Suck it, Giuliani!
__label__-1	Disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Washington voters is cool.
__label__-1	Yeah college professors had the ability to figure out if you plagiarized half of a sentence in a 20 page term paper from pretty much any website or book in existence in seconds at least a decade ago, no shit the FBI can scan through 650,000 text emails in a week.
__label__-1	groping the crystal ball
__label__1	let me guess... she's voting for trump isn't she?
__label__-1	She should, she created them.
__label__-1	nice
__label__1	"I guess we were wrong about what he meant when he told his supporters to go to ""certain places"" and watch for cost fraud."
__label__1	Wrong.
__label__-1	I wonder how many times she had to have a nap in the middle.
__label__-1	So great that he led to POTUS Trump.
__label__-1	So Tolerant
__label__1	*slow clap* So proud.
__label__-1	Ryan and McConnell say Nyet!
__label__1	This will certainly stop Trump from becoming president
__label__-1	Maybe we should waterboarding him so he can form an experienced opinion
__label__-1	the empathy of one as well.
__label__-1	Hasta la vista ISIS
__label__-1	America is going back to the 80s.
__label__-1	the owner of this site is Trump's son in law
__label__-1	Please try to get video of as many of the protesters as possible, especially if they are inciting and committing violence.
__label__1	Yeah, that totally would have worked.
__label__1	It was all a con, what a shocker
__label__-1	One thing the Democrats absolutely have to be careful of when cleaning up shop is to make sure they do not get co-op'd by rabid SJW fundamentalists.
__label__-1	This is what corruption looks like.
__label__1	[*Looks back too all those times the same was said about Obama*] Yeah you are totally right!
__label__-1	May Obama isn't moving out?
__label__1	Wow, what a kind and generous man
__label__1	Job security is a great thing going into a recession.
__label__-1	How many ivy league degrees do these guys have?
__label__-1	Looks like electing Donald Trump has unforeseen benefits
__label__-1	Its sad to see how much the Trump haters are reaching, you have become the thing you hate.
__label__-1	Why wasn't Bernie this upset when HRC and the DNC undermined his campaign?
__label__1	Talk like that is why Trump won.
__label__-1	Paid rioters
__label__-1	Once you go Barack, you never go back.
__label__1	Well Muslims dont deserve rights
__label__1	but trump made him do it!
__label__-1	Inb4 liberal victim blaming.
__label__1	Yes let's start hiring based on race, f*** skills.....which explains why white nationalists supported Trump.
__label__1	Didn't see that coming
__label__-1	human, male, american, fathers, presidents... there's some room for more difference.
__label__-1	well herr Bannon certainly has that little air about him.
__label__-1	I wonder how different that is than the amount that felt less proud before the election
__label__1	Off to a great start!
__label__-1	Remember you're not allowed to call them that or the True Americans will get upset and vote against you out of spite
__label__1	Thank you people who voted for him and people who stayed at home.
__label__-1	Just like how Obama was going to take everyone's guns?
__label__1	The one about the Muslims is not at all like hitlars propaganda of the Jews.
__label__1	Wait, I thought Trump and Hillary were the same?
__label__1	Just until we figure out what's going on!
__label__-1	Then stop having business meetings.
__label__-1	Apparently, no issue with getting drunk off your ass and smoking as much tobacco as you can get your hands on.
__label__-1	Are we taking salon seriously now?
__label__1	I'm sure the CBS polls are real this time
__label__-1	Be patient, the sell-off will come.
__label__1	I feel America getting greater already, aren't you excited everyone?
__label__-1	That is more true then most people believe.
__label__-1	Did this woman have some sort of cerebral accident?
__label__-1	I get it, because Ben is urban, right?
__label__1	I'm glad Breitbart was on top of this.
__label__-1	You will miss it when your job is sourced to robotics and you suffer from some ailment that you then have to pay $60k for that you do not have.
__label__-1	This witch hunt is getting crazier each day
__label__1	Oh no, please don't replace my ridiculously expensive healthcare.
__label__-1	Or, that he dog-whistles to white supremacists...
__label__1	If passed I'm sure this law would have no negative consequences
__label__-1	Proof?
__label__1	I could be an NFL quarterback if you deduct the fact I throw the ball like a 6 year old girl Basically I'm saying I'm Tim Tebow
__label__-1	HEY EVERYONE THIS GUY IS A LOONEY TUNE See, no one cares.
__label__-1	Hardly political.
__label__1	You see though Trump once held a gay pride flag so that means he will be best, biglyest president for the gays.
__label__-1	Well hopefully they get cancer and die without healthcare and can't vote in the next one.
__label__-1	Why not?
__label__-1	I always wondered who was backing those douchebags.
__label__1	Oh boy, I can't wait for Democrats to nominate Hilary in 2020
__label__-1	ITT: pissing contest
__label__1	At least Bill O'Reilly wore a tie.
__label__-1	Just more proof showing that the non-invasive Israeli method is absolutely superior.
__label__-1	Please use another citation... headlines by themselves are not credible.
__label__-1	It's c14 depletion in the atmosphere caused by the eminese burning of c14 depleted fossile fuels
__label__1	Because science has a well established liberal bias.
__label__1	That makes me feel so much safer!
__label__-1	Well it is clearly Bush's fault
__label__1	Oh here is KochReason, all ready to announce the TeaPublican Congress they elected is going to repeal the domestic spying operation.
__label__1	Unfortunately, the Obama administration has a secret interpretation of copyright law
__label__1	Yeah, but then nothing would trickle down
__label__-1	I'd sure like to meet one of those 60%ers and marvel at their disposable income!
__label__-1	Anyone know if the NYPD Strangler will actually face punishment in the courts?
__label__-1	Not a problem for Oklahoma as they obviously consider an education to be overrated.
__label__-1	And Republicans tend to look more at the color in one's wallet
__label__1	Facts and logic don't win arguments, guns do!
__label__1	I believe her.
__label__1	As a rational thinking human being, I trust the National Enquirer with all the hard-hitting and accurate news.
__label__-1	Funny how people react after generations of systemic ghettoization, dehumanization, and lack of justice.
__label__-1	fuck its sad that this guy will be killed if he comes any closer to becoming president.
__label__-1	What has surprised me about his campaign is how disciplined he is - he clearly smart as a whip
__label__1	Expect a hard hitting interview.
__label__1	I wonder where they would have gotten that impression?
__label__1	OH that's a reliable news site.
__label__1	But she's planning for strong regulations.
__label__-1	Many of the large Charter schools in my area that popped up 8-10 years ago with fan-fare and news coverage are gone.
__label__1	If there's one thing that makes college affordable, it's government regulation
__label__-1	I was just starting to feel the chafe.
__label__-1	Fuck, if this had been a Democrat, politifact would have switched income in for wages and said Mostly True.
__label__1	They just need to get Trump to fly to Dallas.
__label__1	Hey well at least we are replacing public schools with corporate-run charters, that should totally help to teach critical thinking skills.
__label__1	Now can we call him a nazi?
__label__1	As a worker, it feels great to know taxes are being handed out of my paycheck to be sent back to the corporation that I help produce profits.
__label__-1	Trump should, of his own accord, take to Twitter to denounce this bullshit.
__label__1	Because they sure did well by cozying up to the Republicans.
__label__-1	This is what it has come to, the POTUS refusing to release a budget because he doesn't want the American public to know where he really stands on the issues, and that working and middle class people are about to get fucked by a giant red, white and blue dick.
__label__1	Gee ya think?
__label__1	10/10 diplomatic skills
__label__-1	lmao
__label__1	"Nah nah correlation is not causation those states just have more ""urban thugs"""
__label__-1	It couldn't happen to a nicer yellow journalist.
__label__-1	too little too late
__label__1	Great, that conformation and other biases magically only affect the left.
__label__1	He also started talking about something to do with 3/5ths, but someone quickly shushed him and we didn't get to hear more
__label__-1	The Part-time President.
__label__-1	If you listen to the alt-reich, all of the progress in the world was done by white men, and media portrayals of women and people of color as heroes is just unrealistic pandering that attacks the foundation of their white supremacist worldview.
__label__1	Lol I thought the election could never be hacked obama
__label__1	Great observation!
__label__1	Yeah, but he won 3 states by less than 1% of the vote (despite also not actually winning a majority) so that doesn't matter.
__label__1	I, too, find that all the least fake news about Russia comes from the Czech Republic.
__label__1	What a productive use of transition time!
__label__1	So now that he's cooperating, he will release his tax returns and put this Russia stuff to bed!
__label__1	Yea our new buddy Russia, the winning, oh the winning
__label__-1	She's a nasty woman.
__label__1	It's a good thing the ec are such an ethical bunch of guys.
__label__1	It'll be interesting to see just exactly how he's gonna enforce that.
__label__1	...and I'm sure that Bernie is close to becoming the Democratic nominee.
__label__-1	Okay then.
__label__1	Well, it's not like Trump would ever apologise either, so does that also qualify him as someone with integrity?
__label__1	What's wrong with dividing the world between the US and Russia?
__label__-1	Why not use a tag that label them for what they are: lies and propaganda?
__label__1	I believe it
__label__-1	Once again Obama is on point.
__label__1	Hey now don't come at Nate Cardboard like that, he admitted that he was super wrong and stuff jeez!
__label__1	Because everybody knows the republicans are all angels.
__label__-1	yes but you need to send jill stein cash money
__label__1	What a shock
__label__-1	Maybe he thinks surrounding himself with billionaires will make him a billionaire.
__label__-1	To misquote Jason Bourne: there is no measure to how hard and how fast Trump supporters will ignore this.
__label__-1	Is there anyone who is not completely full of shit?
__label__1	Who could have seen this coming?
__label__-1	This is such a non issue no American wants to do these jobs so they need the temp workers from Mexico
__label__1	Finally, I can get back to discriminating against the LGBTQ people, with Obama gone it didn't make sense being a racist anymore.
__label__-1	May?
__label__-1	A gofundme effort cannot be far behind.
__label__1	Good thing the Trumplings didn't vote for the candidate that wanted war!
__label__-1	We gotta make sure we can destroy all the insects too.
__label__1	But, her emails!
__label__-1	"Trump supporters are already further enabling the ""us vs them"" mentality by regurgitating his rhetoric."
__label__1	Nah, he's super smart.
__label__1	I feel bad for the veterans.
__label__-1	This is the 5th thread with exact same title.
__label__-1	Man, does this guy always look like this, or did they manage to snap the most evil looking shot they could of him?
__label__1	Sounds like Obama is just a sexist BernieBro to me
__label__1	But both sides should get equal coverage, as they both have valid points.
__label__-1	I agree with the sentiment that we should boot the UN from American soil, just NOT for the reason given in the article.
__label__1	The Pentagon will love this logic.
__label__1	Wow, I'm so glad that weed smokers will get what they deserve for harming so many people.
__label__-1	Or they could be trying to lower premiums for everyone else
__label__1	Take your time, Trump, don't overexert yourself.
__label__-1	These people will be targeted for retribution, mark my words.
__label__-1	The supreme court overturned busing, it's no longer okay to bus them to better schools.
__label__1	Yea...better go with Obama.
__label__1	Firefighters, who need firefighters, give me big cooperation's any day.
__label__1	"Yea because it would be so awful if people were allowed to honor kill family members and not be able to get away with it, since its ""part of their culture""."
__label__1	must be some of those danged wimmens again!
__label__-1	Desperation at it's finest.
__label__-1	Hell no, idiots with shitloads of money are what campaigns are built on!
__label__-1	US is doing harm to itself by bullying the world, holywood helped the world love americans, but in the last 2 decades, especially now, its all going to shit.
__label__-1	The government should have let them fail too.
__label__-1	No.
__label__-1	To be fair, this $4000 million stadium probably brings in more economic activity than that
__label__-1	...aaaahnnddd that, folks, is how it works.
__label__1	Yes, because certainly there were no increases in premiums *before* ACA.
__label__1	But then how can I enforce my position in society, if everyone has food to eat!
__label__1	So, in other words they have abolished two peoples student loan debts?
__label__1	But can't decide which?
__label__-1	Why havn't these guys dropped out yet?
__label__1	Well, in Carson's defense...they both sank with all hands lost.... Definitely
__label__-1	Something something.....*Devil's money*.
__label__-1	Hillary is more hawkish then some of the GOP candidates
__label__-1	Question - if this happens so blatantly and they get away with it, what's stopping them from doing this for the presidential and congressional elections next year?
__label__1	R/politics covering for a Democrat, now I've seen everything.
__label__-1	Guess they're the only ones not receiving kickbacks from the endemic corruption in the bloated US military system
__label__-1	Bernbots are fuming again!
__label__-1	Because he has very little chance of winning the nomination
__label__1	He has a lot more voices in his head than anyone else in Washington, so must have more information.
__label__1	Never seen a politician do that before.
__label__-1	Except atheists, they're the bastard children.
__label__-1	He's trolling us with the plot to X-Men
__label__-1	To be honest though, it's nice to know he's actually capable to get a super pac.
__label__1	Ted Cruz is running?
__label__-1	I think we're still talking about abortion because they *are* actually successfully pushing back abortion access in states they dominate, though.
__label__-1	Anyone who thinks the NSA has stopped bulk surveillance, is at best a moron.
__label__-1	Rubio is nothing more than a younger face on the same old, GOP crap.
__label__1	But he's draining the swamp!
__label__-1	Plz upbote me so I can bash this ass hole more my comments are getting dicked by the system
__label__-1	My computer is safe.
__label__-1	Because personal responsibility means only being accountable to yourself!
__label__1	"I guess it make sense... in the same line of thought as ""If u have nothing to hide, u should not worry about privacy""... in this case it is something like ""if we told you that we are ethical, there is no need for independent watchdog"""
__label__1	ah yes because the democrats are the bastion of integrity and honesty
__label__-1	However, the politician that put it into place was busted for cocaine possession.
__label__1	It's okay, guys: i'm sure this will be the moment when Trump finally comes out against the white supremacists his election has emboldened!
__label__1	Only the best for government work!
__label__-1	Swamping the drain.
__label__1	But T_D is satire and should have never been taken seriously so it doesn't count
__label__-1	Because fucking over 20 million Americans wasn't enough; they want to fuck over women, too.
__label__-1	The trump defenders have proved only one thing to us, no matter who got elected, they just want to watch the world burn.
__label__1	I for one welcome the sudden increase in teen pregnancy.
__label__1	In future history this will be regarded as the high point of him fulfilling his campaign promises.
__label__-1	I wonder where the next goalpost will be.
__label__1	Thanks Trump voters.
__label__-1	Maybe someone will dox this reporter and we could follow him around and harass him.
__label__1	If only we had more people with guns, there wouldn't be as many shootings.
__label__1	Bro, if they're in the two comma club or the three comma club, why does it matter?
__label__-1	More from a narcissist trying to remain relevant.
__label__1	Someone needs to tell Schumer and the Dems to grow up!
__label__1	America, home of the free
__label__-1	Areligious people continue to be one of the most underrepresented political groups in America.
__label__1	Yeah, we really should make an effort to bring back polio.
__label__1	But the Russians are our friends they would NEVER act against US interests!
__label__-1	of course they are saying that.
__label__1	Yeah, just look at Ann Coulter!
__label__-1	The man thinks he is doing God's work, a pile of petitions ain't gonna change his mind or his course of action.
__label__1	But Breitbart and Infowars are beacons of truth
__label__-1	I appreciate this but as I watched outnumbered to get my daily intake of their side, it was pretty insane the way they are rationalizing almost everything he does.
__label__-1	I'm confused, are liberals for or against NATO today?
__label__1	Yes, because this is what the country should be focused on right now.
__label__1	Grandpa gonna hook us up some tin cans and string then see what them ruskies can do!
__label__1	Ted Nugent is hoping for an ambassadorship to Thailand
__label__-1	Yes Sir Mr Putin, please don't release the two girls and Trump video.
__label__-1	sounds about right, Trump realises there is benefit to being jingoistic but seems to generally think people who take part in protests or fight as part of the armed forces are 'dummies'
__label__-1	- Abandon all hope ye who enter here
__label__1	Of course not, because there are black people there
__label__1	Don't worry, they are only repealing Obamacare not the aca
__label__1	It's not the ACA that is being repealed, it's Obamacare!
__label__1	That's just smart business.
__label__1	It'll trickle down.
__label__-1	74% of people are journalists.
__label__1	It's totally not coming from the Russians
__label__1	Still, he doesn't get it, he's white.
__label__-1	Yes reminds me of the time whenever anyone would go against clinton and DWS called up their boss to get them fired
__label__-1	Because otherwise the crowds would be laughably tiny.
__label__-1	Obama should resign today making Joe Biden the 45th POTUS just to ruin all of Trump's inauguration merchandise.
__label__-1	Trump would privatize the military if it made him a buck
__label__1	I'm sure Trump will now give up his presidency because of this
__label__-1	no conflict, no conflict, you're the conflict!
__label__-1	What self respecting Hispanic would serve with him anyway?
__label__-1	Wow, this will surely go over well.
__label__-1	My cousin has a PHD in English Literature, works for Google, and has a million pound flat in London.
__label__-1	Does this guy also happen to own CNN?
__label__-1	How can.he have an approval rating before he does anything
__label__-1	Well that didn't take long.
__label__-1	Thank you, London!
__label__-1	Well, if they'd just die--the GOP's hopes for America would be just so much easier.
__label__1	So he is honoring the majority of the peoples choice and stepping down?
__label__1	At least he doesn't have ties to Putin
__label__1	But but Trump supporters had to work that's why they weren't there
__label__1	only white people have families, blacks just have illegitimate kids.
__label__1	And George Soros paid each of these protesters 3,000 bucks!
__label__1	But Obama was the censorship dictator!
__label__1	See, CNN definitely has a liberal bias, just like Trump said, they are just out to get him.
__label__-1	About the same size as trumps inauguration right there
__label__1	State media yayyy
__label__-1	How about you go back to Australia, Nicky.
__label__1	After Trump's inauguration of course!
__label__-1	A lot more people were home watching tv, unemployed 8 years ago.
__label__1	At what point does the Pentagon just Coup .
__label__1	United States is best America.
__label__-1	He must have wished him a very, very, very, very very merry Christmas
__label__1	Oh good, next time conservatives will get to gripe about actual economic anxiety.
__label__1	The coal folks in those swing states must be so excited that all of this oil will be flowing into the US
__label__-1	He doesn't really want the job and he trying to do what he can to get out.
__label__-1	"""So let's cut taxes further"" said the least intelligent people."
__label__1	Thanks Obummer.
__label__-1	Thanks Stein Voters.
__label__1	This is very surprising to me.
__label__-1	Donald did say he was interested in going to mars, didn't he?
__label__1	Gee, I sure do love my state!
__label__-1	Sounds like they want to make sure that their big oil and gas buddies interests are not impeded.
__label__1	Well...he needs some place to put the journalists.
__label__1	It's reassuring to know that it's actually Bill O'Reilly that's shaping policy!
__label__1	Wow, I for one am thoroughly shocked
__label__1	he is probably hard at work setting up a new 'Classy Walls, LLC' company under Baron's name to award contracts to.
__label__1	We need to make sure that the science is alternative science.
__label__-1	"How about ""Trump First, Then you other fucks can have the scraps."
__label__1	noooo but the emailsssss
__label__1	The wall just got 10 feet higher
__label__1	I'm sure this won't affect prices of anything Trump supporters buy.
__label__-1	We are not North Korea.
__label__1	To drain the swamp bro.
__label__-1	Guess which former, recent president lived there?
__label__-1	I thought Kim Jung Un was the sole source of truth.
__label__-1	Just rename planned Parenthood to the center for the blessed mother.
__label__1	Thank god, I was so worried about our military not being strong enough.
__label__-1	lol hello fake news
__label__-1	Maybe Google should hire Americans then.
__label__1	Yeah, worked out great for Tony Blair...
__label__1	Lol yes I can really see how a physical barrier between USA and Mexico serves the Israeli best interest
__label__1	"it isn't ""Jews Lives Matter"" its ""ALL Lives Matter"""
__label__1	I bet this judge is a secret Muslim
__label__1	Left-wing Telegraph at it again.
__label__-1	That sure sounds familiar.
__label__-1	When even Boris Johnson says you're going too far.
__label__-1	Can we agree that protesting inside an airport isn't the best strategy?
__label__1	Soros probably paid them.
__label__1	Yeah but those 51% are all illegal immigrants voting.
__label__-1	"""Because my specific situation causes me outrage, the premise of the law must surely be false"" ~ Jeanyus Asston Kootcher."
__label__-1	Can't make this shit up.
__label__-1	Maybe he meant that gro_ing stuff?
__label__-1	man, the comment section is brutal.
__label__-1	And has already been confirmed to have only voted in one because thankfully all those states have voter ID requirements...
__label__-1	That story doesn't sound manufactured at all.
__label__-1	i get your point but that picture makes me sick.
__label__1	They can move to the South Side...
__label__1	I knew this would be a contested election that wouldn't have a clear a winner for a while...I'm not saying there definitely wasn't, but the problem with our system is you have to prove it...Pesky problem there
__label__1	This definitely isn't comparing apples and oranges at all
__label__1	Of course he does... FROM KENYA!
__label__1	Its photoshopped, I can tell by the pixels
__label__-1	Sarah who?
__label__-1	Isn't providing support to a foreign country over America considered treason?
__label__-1	About damn time they give us some rights back.
__label__-1	Well, I suspect his wrist felt mighty sore after that slap now didn't it?
__label__1	Oh China
__label__-1	Isn't that what US Magazine and Cosmo are for?
__label__-1	This is ridiculous - anyone even remotely familiar with religious dealings knows the Loch Ness Monster is just a remnant of Aleister Crowley's work at Loch Ness.
__label__-1	The callousness, hatred, and lack of empathy among American workers for others in their class is sickening and saddening.
__label__1	Jesus would have scolded her too!
__label__1	"Yes, Dems respect for bills that have ""already been passed by congress"" on guns is paramount."
__label__-1	File criminal charges and bust up both companies into little pieces.
__label__1	That ought to stop all the bullet conspiracy theories.
__label__1	Protected and Served.
__label__-1	And he taught constitutional law?
__label__1	But you can carry a gun in the US of A so it all balances out in the end.
__label__-1	By the time the cancer clusters show up, will the statute of limitations have run out on prosecuting the guilty?
__label__-1	To whom?
__label__1	What is it with Texas and putting the mentally handicapped into the governorship?
__label__1	It's nice to to see the GOP focusing on the *real* problems facing America
__label__1	Sounds like 38% of Republicans are god damned RINO's!
__label__1	Yeah, but how many more people will go to *hell*?
__label__-1	Or equally unstable as the case may be.
__label__-1	I'll take the job.
__label__-1	"""Free Press"" in the US is an illusion."
__label__-1	The miracle of small government.
__label__-1	Gee I don't know are they Diebold machines?
__label__1	Obviously this person wasn't mentally ill; while all those white guys shooting up churches, schools, universities, theatres, black protesters were all obviously mentally ill and not normal
__label__-1	why risk it?
__label__1	Oh yea, maybe this will stump him.
__label__1	Don't worry.. He's a brilliant negotiator, he can work well with everyone
__label__1	Ya, and the Washington Examiner is a newspaper.
__label__-1	All you Democrat voting retards are getting played like a fucking fiddle.
__label__-1	Any more debates and these morons will be literally flinging feces at each other.
__label__-1	Jesus Christ this guy is a flipping jagaloon.
__label__1	Well, then we should ban all cars, clearly!
__label__-1	Maybe she fainted again.
__label__1	I doubt they're nine cause white supremacists tend to be much older than that, in their teens at least.
__label__-1	If Bernie is elected big business and all the job with it are going to flee America, he will destroy the economy.
__label__-1	"Inb4 2016 is the ""warmest"" on record."
__label__-1	Civil War 2 is here now?
__label__-1	One of the better nominees tbh.
__label__1	Look at what he has done for Alabama.
__label__-1	This can't possibly have anything to do with our new SoS being the recent CEO of a major drilling company, can it?
__label__1	Don't you know that terrorism is only terrorism when it happens to white people.
__label__-1	Could the Reporter's publication sue on the basis of freedom of the press?
__label__-1	The presidency.
__label__-1	That's what I thought!
__label__1	Why would we want unpolluted streams
__label__-1	That's illegal as fuck and grounds for impeachment.
__label__-1	Everything they do is stupid, we've elected an idiot
__label__-1	A hoax perpetuated by people so powerful and diabolical that they could hire actors to fill an entire town for years and years, but so inept that they rehired actors from other crises and arranged for port-a-potties ahead of time.
__label__-1	After only 2 weeks Trump only needs 87 to catch up.
__label__-1	cuckservative confirmed
__label__-1	I wonder how Bushes presidency would have been if it wasnt for 9/11 and the Iraq war.
__label__-1	Had to change out his testosterone patch and adult diaper.
__label__1	I mean if Putin himself says he didn't kill those guys, how can we really know who did?
__label__-1	So, less tax money will go for something people don't need.
__label__1	This was clearly the work of Barack Obama.
__label__1	Wow hes getting great respect from enemies and friends!
__label__-1	More Gaslighting from the Dumpster admin.
__label__1	Obviously the BBC is fake news...
__label__1	Glad she's in charge of education
__label__1	Democracy works!
__label__-1	Your title is bad and you should feel bad.
__label__-1	I feel like, every time I see another headline about this, I get just a little bit angrier.
__label__1	Never forget.
__label__1	Hey let's let our country get covered in smog and our rivers get polluted.
__label__-1	The problem is that the rules are whatever the majority wants them to be.
__label__1	Well, he's finally utilizing @POTUS.
__label__-1	Sounds more like Hillary
__label__1	I'm sure Sessions will get right on that.
__label__-1	Uh huh, all of a sudden they like Obamacare huh?
__label__1	Well if Obama had reached across.
__label__-1	"""So-called Judge"" stands up for the rule of law."
__label__-1	How could anyone pretend to hate Ivanka Trump.
__label__1	I'm glad that Trump is not divisive like Barack Obama.
__label__-1	If enough information in the dossier is confirmed to toss Trump out of office, I will name my first-born child Dossier.
__label__-1	There has never been more slime in the swamp than what Trump brought to it.
__label__1	Don't worry guys, Jason Chaffetz is on it.
__label__1	Alternative Fact; she will be promoted for being so gosh darn amazing at her job!
__label__-1	The country has a means of shutting it down if it's treason
__label__1	This is clearly the real scandal.
__label__-1	So he's got like 6 months tops to get this done
__label__-1	Lets fully legalize suppressors next!
__label__-1	So are they trying to paint CNN as the Left's Fox, without the bimbos and the insane commentators?
__label__-1	having your government being taken over by a psychotic republican coup is never fun.
__label__1	Well considering Alabama is so well renowned for it's education, this comes as no surprise.

__label__-1	I can't live on this planet anymore.
__label__1	Wait, so you're telling me that preventing pregnancies will lower the rate of terminated pregnancies?
__label__-1	Well to be fair, whether you agree *or* disagree with Romney on *anything*, you will end up having to deal with the problem at some point.
__label__1	Good thing there are all these voter ID laws to disenfranchise democrats to stop voter fraud.
__label__1	Welfare for poor people is the work of the devil, welfare for oil companies and venture capitalists is a God given entitlement.
__label__-1	It's the Muslims!
__label__-1	Why do we give that huckster any attention at all?
__label__1	Yes, Obama has been very tough on Wall Street.
__label__-1	Totally off-topic observation, but man, that dude's put on a lot of weight since 2008.
__label__1	The GOP supermajority in Alabama had nothing to do with it.
__label__1	Le FUCK FAUX NEWS XD
__label__-1	The fact that there's people who deserve to be paid more &amp; accept being paid less yet at the same time think these people don't deserve to be paid a living wage is even more retarded.
__label__-1	Jealousy is an ugly thing.
__label__-1	Ah yes who would be more unbiased then hospital executives.

__label__-1	What a waste of Carbon.
__label__-1	The campaign said it'll be out Monday.
__label__1	I think you forgot this;

__label__1	But... but the republicans told me it was all the illegal immigrants's fault we losing so much money
__label__-1	She voted for the war in Iraq and didn't support gay marriage until this year.

__label__-1	Just another mostly black state bordering Georgia.
__label__-1	NEW YORK -- Front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton swept to victory with ease in Tuesday's New York primary, with Trump bouncing back from a difficult stretch in the Republican contest and Clinton pushing closer to locking up the Democratic nomination.
__label__1	This is the woman we should all be voting for!
__label__-1	So a normal night in Atlanta?
__label__-1	The irony of a war hawk campaigning for stricter gun laws is clearly lost on Dunham.
__label__1	That should accomplish a lot
__label__-1	Well someone has to and Hillary openly said she wouldn't.
__label__-1	This is from freebeacon so is about as reliable as a fortune cookie, but... ... Hot sauce bottles are heavy, man, especially for an old lady to have to carry.
__label__-1	Luckily he named Fiorina as his VP, so that will distract people from a colossal fuck up with another colossal fuck up.
__label__1	Just remember, anything is better than Hillary's neoliberal policies which basically copy Germany!
__label__1	No dude, the stupid black voters in the south (conservative states that don't matter) don't know whats best for them
__label__1	Well, he didn't assassinate Obama bin Biden, did he?
__label__-1	Anyone else think that term limits for the legislative branch would go a long way toward cleaning up these scandals?
__label__1	You mean Perry in 1st, Romney in 2nd, and Bachmann following up behind?
__label__1	"But... but... who would be our ""enemy""..."
__label__-1	He is about to find out it is far easier to create a monster than it is to kill one.
__label__1	But it isn't FAIR!
__label__-1	When was that idea ever a good one?
__label__1	"It's a good thing that big healthcare ""reform"" passed and lowered the cost of healthcare for everyone."
__label__-1	Someone please tell me that is sarcasm.

__label__-1	The US is the only first world country that doesn't require someone to prove they are a citizen before allowing them to vote in a public election.
__label__-1	And Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner is threatening to impeach him for it.
__label__-1	I like how this has 10 comments but not one upvote.

__label__-1	That someone running for President of the United States would even have to say something like this is a definite low point in history.
__label__1	Can't Stump The Trump!
__label__-1	Probably has his tax returns stored on Hillary's server.
__label__-1	It's a damn shame someone had to die before these idiots were put into jail.
__label__1	You should still kneel at Hillary's heels because Donald is worse!
__label__-1	But then who will tell it like it is
__label__1	Some antibiotics will help with that.
__label__1	He needed those explosives and guns to protect himself from a tyrannical goobermint that restricts his free speech.
__label__-1	Good point, better elect Trump instead
__label__-1	Flip flop, Flip flop, Flip flop!
__label__1	Nah, just leading them to a slaughter.
__label__1	Because he's Voldemort
__label__1	Bernie or bust though!
__label__-1	Hillary has a way of finding trouble.
__label__1	Just a right wing conspiracy
__label__1	Everyone else did it, she was given clearance
__label__-1	Just as an FYI, if the IG were to come out with an investigation like this for anyone else, they would be fired and certainly not have a chance to comment publicly.
__label__1	It wasn't perjury, she was just mistaken
__label__1	Yeah, who can stand 74 months of steady job growth?
__label__-1	Isnt that the TSA slogan?
__label__-1	Trump supporters pretending to be anti-Trump to stir up trouble.
__label__-1	They sound so disappointed in her.

__label__-1	"Do ""second amendment remedies"" apply to States?"
__label__-1	"jesus, what does it say about that ""church"" when the fucking Klan finds them repugnant?"
__label__1	That'll sell more guns at least.
__label__1	filibuster this communist anti-capitalist Marxist filth of a law.
__label__1	Good thing that is clean coal, otherwise we would have an environmental disaster on our hands.
__label__-1	Very we'll said Comrade Krugman.
__label__1	But is it worth having your life saved when you're forced to live in a communist state?
__label__1	Godless Muslim asshole.
__label__1	Because poor people don't deserve anything nice, amirite?
__label__-1	Didn't President Obama have a lackluster record of being late and/or only voting present?
__label__-1	so the $2-$5 ATM fees can pile up?
__label__-1	Thumbnail looks like he's Muslim ....or emperor palpatine
__label__1	But if GM doesn't get the tax break how will all that money trickle down to us poor folk.
__label__1	Another day in the war on Christianity, they're so persecuted.
__label__-1	That's for the peasants

__label__1	Another new and innovative idea from the republicans.
__label__-1	He would still be waiting for me.
__label__-1	how nice and convenient all of these endorsements are as it keeps dripping
__label__-1	This article says a whole lot of nothing.
__label__-1	"Title should read: ""Rich Billionaire Asshole Spends Millions of Dollars to Attack Other Rich Billionaire Asshole"""
__label__1	But, you know, this is Breitbart, so we can ignore it until it gets big enough for CNN to cover it.
__label__-1	This is what were up against, everyone get concealed carry licenses, they are so self-absorbed and beyond saving
__label__1	"No doubt the only polling places that will be closed will be in Sander's strongholds and no doubt the few polling places Sanders voters will go to will be blockaded by Bill ""The Wall"" Clinton."

__label__1	I've never known a Republican that didn't have one black friend.
__label__1	He brings out the best in people, doesn't he?
__label__1	I'm sure this theft was reported right away and isn't something they just made up to smear Sanders and deflect attention.
__label__-1	Muh opreshun
__label__1	If youre losing and you think there is fraud, SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU SORE LOSER
__label__-1	No one can judge emporer Trump.
__label__1	No way he will change his mind and endorse Trump in a few weeks.
__label__-1	This isn't 'news', it's from 6 years ago.
__label__-1	"Most people on reddit also don't know what Net-Neutrality means and are just for it because it has the word ""neutral"" in it."
__label__1	I'm sure this thread will go a long way toward proving him wrong.
__label__-1	Yes, Obama's comments on Hillary during the most desperate phase of his campaign are definitely the most reliable reflections of her character.
__label__-1	Trickle down racism doesn't work.
__label__-1	He's a republican what do you expect?

__label__1	But Clinton doesn't let these people influence her politics
__label__-1	The United States will sell just about any weapon to just about any nation.
__label__1	If you can't setup a home server to avoid FOIA requests and reduce transparency, then who would ever want to be secretary of state... the accountability would be too stressful!
__label__-1	Yeah, this is getting worse for Hillary by the day and she is going to drag down a lot of innocent State staffers who were just following her top aides' directives.
__label__-1	The needle is moving in the right direction.
__label__1	Then Mexico would definitely pay for that wall!
__label__-1	"Canadians and Britons say, ""If my health care was in the hands of a corporation I'd be afraid."""
__label__1	Forget about the war and health care and the economy and housing - why won't Obama show us his birth certificate?
__label__1	"I think it was because someone in the republican party suddenly realised ""The Pledge"" was a pile of steaming crap."
__label__-1	normally this would infuriate me but it's berkeley so i'm kind of jealous of the officers instead of mad this time around.
__label__1	Does zero-tolerance mean intolerance?
__label__1	Yes, I'm sure the voice of reason will bless this comment section on this topic.

__label__-1	So that's what Jay Z and Kanye ment when going ham.
__label__-1	Does the imaginary gun ban get to hang out with the imaginary WMD over at the Inside the Unreality Bubble Lounge?
__label__-1	Well to be fair, as Obama's second term begins, a lot of people are or will be stepping down.
__label__-1	"I agree gun control advocates need to listen to gun owners, and here is what gun owners are saying ""NO MORE NEW GUN LAWS"""
__label__-1	Try saying that three times fast!
__label__-1	Just once I would like to see my state show up in the news without having to face palm.
__label__1	You'd think so, but personal, arbitrary, and ill defined freedom is more important than public health.
__label__1	Sure he does, and he and the rest of the politicians who run this country totally aren't bought out by corporate interests.
__label__-1	And a sharp stick in the eye is good for vision.
__label__1	"""Whaaaaaaaa, but my Big Mac is gonna cost more, Whaaaaaaa""."
__label__1	Moochelle is at it again!
__label__-1	If this isn't proof that the state government of Florida is unbelievably racist, then I don't know what is.
__label__-1	Who is surprised by this?
__label__-1	"I guess someone should have added ""corporate fascism"" to the list of stuff Americans should hate."
__label__1	Thanks Obama!
__label__-1	How does a man run for public office with a face that is that punchable?
__label__1	who could have foreseen such an outcome.
__label__1	If those darn students would just shake off thier indoctrination and vote the right way they wouldn't have to try and stop them.

__label__-1	Keep fucking yourselves, GOP.
__label__-1	I think Christie or Newt would be good choices
__label__1	oh good a news article that will finally explain this for me, i've been looking all over for someone to talk about this but it seems everyone is just too scared
__label__-1	Hopefully they can get him to %15 so we have someone to challenge the two knobs in the debates.
__label__1	Will it be Bernie?

__label__1	No!
__label__-1	what else would shillary fact say?
__label__-1	good
__label__1	But a Trump presidency will force the DNC to move left
__label__1	they didn't mean to ... so please leave them alone.
__label__-1	Well you see, people might not be chanting that if you weren't a shady sack of shit
__label__-1	We all wish, but I don't think it's illegal to oppose your opponent.
__label__1	this is a lot like the Ted Cruz speech
__label__-1	Penis.
__label__-1	Good for her and for Paul Jay in his follow-up interview.
__label__1	No need for fear, I'm sure they have nothing to hide!

__label__1	"Was that a ""bigfoot sighting"" link in the lower right corner?"
__label__1	But I thought people choose to be gay?
__label__1	"""Obamanet"""
__label__1	obviously its because 97% of scientists are corrupt.

__label__-1	As a Virginia resident, I like that I can vote for a third party which represents my views and not be afraid of contributing to a Trump victory in my state.
__label__1	I bet Obama himself took a comically large sack of cash with a money sign on it and give it to his Islamist brothers over there.
__label__1	Oh, well in that case, no one should provide a platform for securely and anonymously leaking institutional malfeasance...
__label__1	Just another example of the most transparent politician in history.
__label__-1	Which words?
__label__1	Don't sweat it; it'll trickle down.
__label__-1	I'm a liberal Democrat, but you can't group together an entire political party like that.
__label__-1	"FTA: Goldmember was quoted as saying, ""I love goooooold!"""

__label__1	Make America Great (for Whites only) Again!
__label__1	2 completely relevant musical acts.

__label__-1	This is just fucking infuriating.
__label__1	But he's really a social liberal!
__label__1	But we don't need glass steagle, right?
__label__-1	Well duh
__label__-1	But let's worry about welfare fraud some more.
__label__1	Yeah, I'm sure Trump is the only candidate in history to pay attention to what the media is saying about him.
__label__-1	Talibangelist are like this.
__label__1	Hospitals should hire more stoned surgeons.
__label__-1	Just like Fiorino, right Barry-o?
__label__-1	Exactly, no one has been able to show that the Clinton foundation has done anything illegal.
__label__-1	Einstein might disagree
__label__-1	"Next Trump headline, ""I know more about physics than Hawking"""
__label__-1	Isn't that a good thing
__label__-1	Please share this with friends, when Clinton dies something right, progressives need to know ASAP.
__label__-1	In the article there is no Clinton inviting chaos.
__label__-1	She is winning, what polls are they looking at?
__label__-1	Doesn't the fact that these people around Clinton did get immunity indicate the FBI was trying to build a case against Hillary?
__label__-1	So *that's* why Pence said Donald's donated 100s of millions to charity, he was confusing him with Zuckerberg!
__label__1	Hillary - He could have been my son!
__label__1	omg burn trump alive, his dad helped him with his future, BURN HIM TOO, this is truly a big schandal
__label__-1	What's a self righteous voter to do?
__label__-1	He's too busy winning the election.
__label__1	I'm sure THIS will finally be the one that does it.
__label__-1	Wow bottom of the barrel here
__label__-1	I see Trump +4 nationally in the latest RCP poll
__label__-1	No kidding GWB is the not benchmark for high quality presidencies.
__label__-1	That was possible?
__label__-1	What about pot and meth battlegrounds?
__label__1	Because catching a couple of fraudsters is worth denying thousands their right to vote.
__label__-1	Pretty much every single post Republican right winger confuses the Constitution with a Choose Your Own Adventure book that allows people to custom build the tyrannical government that least effects them.
__label__1	Masha'Allah.
__label__1	Obviously you're not an alpha
__label__-1	Schools do not exist to rescue poor kids from a culture that vilifies academic excellence.

__label__1	Sure they do.
__label__-1	Pastafarianism.
__label__-1	It's pretty awesome that states are leading the way forward on issues like gay marriage, gun control, marijuana legalization.
__label__-1	Where does it say that in the article?
__label__-1	We added 125,000 immigrants last month and 175,000 college graduates to the workforce, seems to be a math problem here we need to figure out.
__label__-1	News flash!
__label__-1	What bullshit!
__label__1	So what I'm supposed to take from this is that the war on terror worked, right?
__label__1	Yes but that was a much smaller less important disaster
__label__-1	Once again, the all purpose headline boiled down: Fox Blames Obama
__label__-1	The corrupt f*cks in the NY State Senate like Ball should get a taste of their own medicine.
__label__1	Yeah, why couldn't we have a humble president, like George W., or Mittens.
__label__-1	Good Guy Christie.
__label__-1	But for the GOP , that is awful, as the savings is in healthcare costs for average citizens.
__label__1	With that sort of argument, you *know* he must be right.
__label__-1	ethnic cleansing
__label__1	Damn you liberal media!
__label__1	BUT REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS 47%!

__label__1	Said the survey who only polled government public service employees, police officers and telco employees...
__label__-1	This is why it's time to lower the 35 year old minimum age requirement
__label__-1	Voting for someone because they may try to legalize marijuana is about as dumb as voting for Hillary.
__label__-1	You don't see them much in the wild, so taxpayer dollars have to support them if they're going to thrive.
__label__1	Well, if the State Department says it, it must be true.
__label__-1	If we would let the USPS compete with UPS ad FedEx that would be great.
__label__1	you're right, this election is totally different!
__label__-1	"""Surely this will be the end of the Clinton campaign"" says obnoxiously sarcastic voter for the first time ever."
__label__1	Taliban does not understand Trump's 4D Chess, he would nuke them the first day in office
__label__1	Can't wait for the level headed discussion that will follow this article
__label__1	And the Clinton Foundation was heavily funded by Saudi's, who were at least partially responsible for 9/11, but lets not bother ourselves with that.
__label__-1	I think the PA number is off, their's no way it's closer than Florida and this is hte first poll iv ever seen to suggest that, the rest seem to make sense, there's been a big shift towards Trump in OH over the last month but the other states are swinging toward Clinton post debate.
__label__1	This is so insulting
__label__1	Just being a good businessman
__label__-1	People who are tuning in to the weather channel probably believe (subconsciously) that climate change isn't a hoax.
__label__-1	\#GuacTheVote might be my favorite trend of the election

__label__1	Yeah, deceiving the public on your policy positions is good... it proves you're pragmatic.
__label__-1	And the quote has NOTHING to do with sexual assault.
__label__1	Oh no, GOP, Trump wasn't a misogynist before, that's a new thing!
__label__-1	Kasich/Paul 2020
__label__-1	Doing the opposite of what Glenn Beck wants is like a guiding light to most smart people.
__label__-1	Hopefully it won't need to come to it.
__label__1	yeah but was he running for president then?
__label__-1	Well, I better not vote for Bill Clinton in November.
__label__1	Dang, there go all of Clinton's hard-line pro-gun supporters!
__label__-1	Hillary is full of sin, but do you really want this guy conducting foreign policy?
__label__1	You know where that baby emerged from.
__label__1	I am sure Trump referencing becoming unshackled will play well with Black Americans.
__label__1	Who doesn't love a good bowling ball now and then?
__label__1	I guess the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center got bought by Clinton too.
__label__1	Of course, it is TRUMP that is the shining beacon of Christian morality.
__label__-1	Maybe even got himself another Tebow helmet or another yuuuugggeee portrait of himself with that money
__label__1	Guess we need to ban women from voting to unrig the election.
__label__-1	Trump is one sick, rapey bastard.
__label__-1	You think he hasn't done the same to Ivanka?
__label__-1	Fascists, mostly.
__label__-1	Unless you're a Clinton.
__label__1	She's just angling to play her in the movie in 20 years.
__label__1	Well, Trump already attacked them once, why not attack them again, amiright?
__label__1	Stop trivializing sexual assault!
__label__1	That's going to go over real well in Georgia.
__label__-1	Also the biggest tax cut to middle class and lower class.
__label__-1	So dating her at 16 was a possibility to him?
__label__1	I'm hoping for a return of 'saracen' honestly
__label__1	Yeah, I'm sure the slavers made a point to only enslave the non-religious ones.
__label__-1	this has ..........this is a pointless fact
__label__1	Time to up the racism to counteract the sexism
__label__1	I'm sure these groups will cool down after election day
__label__1	The goddamn immigrants for daring to live near my land
__label__1	So the conspiracy was all these years in the making!
__label__1	(((Soros)))
__label__1	Another bombshell.
__label__1	Yeah thats really what America wants.
__label__1	The real point is that trump is going to win the election and everyone is rigging it against him, of *course*
__label__-1	Seems legit
__label__1	This is very surprising
__label__1	This poll must have only been surveying paid shills because we know there are no young people supporting $Hillary.
__label__1	I can't wait for the sequel to the RFRA.
__label__-1	(((BOMBSHELL))) Breaking: KILLSHOT
__label__1	Men are rigging this election.
__label__-1	Don't know why - the statuette's legs are together and covered by a skirt, so it's got no pussy to grab.
__label__-1	To be fair, this is the way Donny treats *everyone*, not just women.
__label__1	Because Hillary is frail, weak, incompetent, and all-powerful-- all at the same time.
__label__1	Biden told Americans to fire a shotgun in the air.... yeah he is smart.
__label__-1	Didn't they give enough?
__label__-1	Wasn't Michelle off the table for him since the gop convention?
__label__-1	Perverts 4 Trump!
__label__-1	I could just as easily say dems don't want the working class to vote.
__label__-1	Well, a nuclear winter would make global warming a moot table point.
__label__-1	Solid!
__label__-1	He stole his mom's credit card cause he's an addict, soon he'll be sucking dicks in alleys to afford his daily paper bag full of edibles
__label__1	Doesn't matter BE AFRAID VOTE TRUMP
__label__-1	Except you know, stand up for your candidate, repeat his message, not contradict him etc.
__label__1	No, dude, have you *seen* her?
__label__-1	As an Arizonan this makes me happy that my state is finally starting to pull its head out of its ass.
__label__-1	Treason, once committed is usually grounds for insurrection.
__label__-1	And this is why you should boycott her fashion line.
__label__1	Not if you know how it is rigged......
__label__-1	We are equally morally obligated to stand up to Hillary.
__label__-1	Only 281?
__label__-1	why is this piece of shit not banned from posting here?
__label__1	Such a nasty man.
__label__1	It'll be taken care of in the next firmware update.
__label__1	There are those illegal voters Donald was warning us about.
__label__-1	Hes doing a good job teaching everyone how to lose an election
__label__-1	That's an insult to pigs.
__label__1	Bet he wishes he has the microphone from the first debate while he was on the bus
__label__-1	Jesus christ this sub is hot garbage water
__label__1	Yeah, this sub totally isn't biased or close-minded.
__label__1	Oh but they just talked about golf and grandkids
__label__-1	A cross between Einstein and Trump?
__label__1	It's essential that those who determine public policy have their values rooted in supernatural belief.
__label__1	Vagina
__label__-1	But emails.
__label__1	Yeah, the election itself sucks just because one of the candidates did so much shit that even with all her money and protected status FBI had to reopen her case.
__label__1	What a crazy pants-on-head cuckoo bird that Bernie Sanders guy is!
__label__-1	Seems like he was treated about as well as the sick and dying first responders who risked their life searching for survivors amid the rubble of the 9/11 Towers destruction.
__label__-1	I really hope the GOP splits.
__label__-1	My guess is that Geraldo gets bumped in favour of Dobbs.
__label__1	Nixon was one greatest minds in history.
__label__-1	It's only a matter of time before the far right will make the claim that facts and logic are liberal socialist ideologies and should thus be avoided
__label__-1	There are eight democratic female legislators in Georgia?
__label__-1	Sure they did, and Africa fights wars with invisible children.
__label__1	because the catholic church has never done aything wrong, the crusades, burning of witches, hundreds of protected priest child molestors are all made up by the liberals
__label__-1	Mannnnnnnn Fuck this guy.
__label__1	Uh... demand a plan?
__label__-1	He didn't learn anything after he stole his first car either.
__label__-1	So... why aren't they going after the GOP?
__label__-1	I say if you've never had to be on food stamps, then you can SHUT THE FUCK UP about how unnecessary you think they are.
__label__1	But we don't know if hairy cock supports it, how can I decide otherwise
__label__1	And just think of all the tax subsidies we could provide to the 1% if we could just get those entitlement junkies to stop eating.
__label__-1	And hedge fund managers make billions a year, who do you think is more valuable to society in general?
__label__1	Well, since cutting taxes raises revenues, then the only logical solution to the lack of revenue is to cut taxes more.
__label__1	Just you wait liberals, Supply-Side Jesus will jump start their economy any day now!
__label__1	If he has nothing to hide, then he shouldn't be worried
__label__1	I see your point...he should be impeached, then.
__label__-1	Also, a 29th amendment on internet freedom.
__label__1	He wouldn't be far off
__label__-1	I thought I was in subredditsimulator for a second.
__label__1	Twist: There are only 8 black congressional caucus members.
__label__1	liberate, not invade.
__label__-1	And this is a bad thing?
__label__-1	Sounds like a job creator to me
__label__1	Bernie Sanders: Enemy of Business
__label__1	Just like SO2 and CFCs
__label__1	Lets throw in some kids that require 3x the care and time into the adoption machine, I am sure they will get picked right up.
__label__-1	does anyone really care about this about as useless a topic as hillarys emails and trumps hair
__label__-1	Eh, I'd consider Lady Gaga as a gay icon
__label__1	Pssh I'm gonna text in my vote to American idol on my Obama phone
__label__1	Well, at least gas, food and lodging got cheaper, and only frivolities like consumer electronics have gone up.
__label__-1	He could just blame obama.
__label__1	But we all know climate change is a Chinese hoax.
__label__-1	Oh boy.
__label__1	Well clearly Judge Vasquez is a Mexican, so of course he's biased against Trump and the RNC.
__label__-1	Duh
__label__-1	Scott Foval strikes again.
__label__-1	"If it's so widely supported and ""common sense"" then why spend so much money on it?"
__label__1	Actually saying it out loud is wrong!
__label__-1	Somebody thinks they are trying to make a Reality TV show instead of running a government.
__label__-1	It is entirely possible her ballot will be invalidated due to social security or vital statistics or whoever does that sort of thing in Texas forwarding a death notice to the elections dept.
__label__-1	doesn't matter, it's Trump, his supporters don't care, he walks on water and will cure us of all that is impure
__label__-1	Here is further info
__label__1	"Yeah, these numbers look good and are based on facts, but people don't ""feel"" like the economy is doing better so therefore it isn't."
__label__1	I guess that's all it will take to get around the wall?
__label__-1	"""Look, it may be true or it may not be, either way the people.."""
__label__-1	I'm not voting and I'm still gonna complain.
__label__1	but he is ruining the economy by lowering the unemployment rate and having steady growth!
__label__-1	I guess that makes up for the drop with the black vote.
__label__1	Shocking
__label__1	Half the time was spent configuring `cygwin`, 10 minutes was spent running `grep` for classified, and then they're done.
__label__1	Oh my god, Wikileaks have finally done it, HRC is done for.
__label__1	but, but, 'MURICA
__label__1	Wow that's pretty on point maybe that guy should run for president.
__label__1	Says who?
__label__1	Wow, it's almost as if people deliberately there to boo him.
__label__-1	Oh how I'll miss hearing from this buffoon for another few years.
__label__1	He needs to put 9/11 somewhere there!
__label__-1	Sadly, the only way for Donald Trump to be elected as the new president would be if the zookeeper that shot harambe was the democratic candidate.
__label__1	Rush was probably trying to polish GW's image.
__label__1	What a shock!
__label__-1	I want off Mr Bones wild ride!
__label__-1	Fuck them
__label__1	Lizards don't cry.
__label__-1	My dream team would be Bernie Sanders and William McRaven as VP, guarantee victory.
__label__-1	According to the GOP, just wait until your wife dies and you will not have to worry about it anymore.
__label__1	"I'm sure if the situation were reversed, all Trump supporters would shrug ""well that's how it goes, she's our fairly elected President."""
__label__1	So it begins.... yes, let's use African Americans as scapegoats, let's make America great again.
__label__1	"I think everyone is forgetting the silent ""for brown people""."
__label__-1	Dear Bernie you are old please don't run
__label__-1	Will someone think of the whites?
__label__-1	Wait till they subtract all the votes they find that came from illegal aliens and then we'll see how many legitimate votes she got.
__label__1	I mentioned this around family yesterday, but thankfully they were there to quickly set me straight on why this story is completely untrue and it's just the media twisting Trump's words.
__label__1	Oh yes, we're really going to beat Trump and the GOP in 2 years by accusing everyone on our side of being shills
__label__-1	I'm sure we'd be pretty pissed if the Russians placed missiles in Cuba.
__label__-1	And not even the smart ones
__label__1	Boy that protest vote/nonvote is paying DIVIDENDS!
__label__-1	Maybe Harry Reid should grab her by the pussy.
__label__1	oh good I was worried for a sec
__label__1	well, that otta work
__label__1	I don't suppose it's still early enough to pass an emergency law abolishing the electoral college and letting us use pure popular vote for elections?
__label__1	Insults like that elected Trump!
__label__1	Guys, don't call them racist because that might hurt their feelings.
__label__1	Gulliani the best AG hire by a president who promised to drain the swamp.
__label__-1	"""oh come on tolerant libruls, give them a chance :("""
__label__1	Must be lots of employed folks protesting
__label__-1	This sub gonna be advocating eco terrorism anytime now
__label__1	Let's just start making pin little yellow crescents to their shirts.
__label__-1	"Even if he's ""not your president,"" it's still quite illegal to threaten him."
__label__1	i hear at 500,000 he has to do it!
__label__1	Yeah, 'cause why would black people want rights and freedoms, amirite?
__label__1	Jamie Dimon for Treasury is a great sign of that
__label__-1	I'm having a *real* hard time disagreeing with them, right now.
__label__-1	Everyone is calling for this, but I guess we only care if Bernie says it?
__label__-1	"I love that our bar is now so low comments like ""Trump probably wont attempt to violate the first amendment rights of the people he doesn't like by abusing executive power"" is considered a positive thing to say about him."
__label__1	But isn't Obamacare great?
__label__1	Obviously a bunch of liars, since it was all a hoax.
__label__-1	Ford never had plans to move plants to Mexico...but what do facts matter.
__label__1	Gee, if only there was something they could have done differently so they wouldn't feel so bad.
__label__-1	Don't worry guys: persecuting religious minorities has, historically, never been a bad thing!
__label__1	I thought OP meant Saudi Arabia at first, great article
__label__-1	Real straight shooter, that Donald.
__label__-1	"Did Melania even ask her to design her dresses or did this designer just dramatically ""quit"" from a job she was never even offered?"
__label__1	But at least we didn't elect that Obviously Corrupt Hillary...!
__label__-1	Says the millennial who can't spell they're*.
__label__1	Lol it's alright when it's all white.
__label__1	Well, one thing we know for sure is Trump is a man of his word.
__label__1	Move along people, nothing to see here.
__label__-1	Question: does anyone know if some of the students involved in the lawsuit were veterans and used GI/veterans benefits to pay for their TU schooling?
__label__1	Exhibit A: Barack HUSSEIN Obamacare
__label__1	Well, considering Ben Carson's assertion that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery, I think abolishing it is a great idea.
__label__1	He is so gracious to not try to jail his political opponents!
__label__1	I can't wait for our bullshit healthcare savings account
__label__1	Man, he sounds like an asshole
__label__-1	I'm sure the people standing there fighting are thankful that you are thinking about them while your gorge on food, in your heated home, peacefully amongst your family.
__label__1	only white people can be racist and they are only found in one of the parties!
__label__-1	Clearly he meant to say that Trump should waterboard the press starting with him.
__label__1	but but but Trump is a racist
__label__-1	In Soviet America, Trump turns away Intelligence.
__label__-1	A white ethnostate.
__label__-1	I agree, but that doesn't excuse Trump's blatant lies, which is what this article is about.
__label__-1	He's just so fucking stupid.
__label__1	But dude they totally stopped World War 3 with Russia!
__label__1	TIL Fish-human hybrids are real.
__label__1	That will stop Trump for sure!
__label__-1	Growth of the primary and secondary sector stalled thus abandoning the gold standard in theory allowed growth through expansion of credit on the under consumption theory.
__label__-1	ha
__label__1	yeah because we should only care about politics once every four years, then sit back and allow the president to do whatever the fuck they want
__label__-1	This whataboutism on every god damn issue needs to stop
__label__-1	Pretty sure you can, they compress the shit out of it.
__label__1	He just wants another swamp to drain, once he's finished with the first one.
__label__1	Well, at least he didn't give any speeches
__label__1	I'm beginning to sense there's a pattern with this Trump guy.
__label__1	But, but, but, Soros is evil!
__label__-1	Bad choice ..Bernie should be elected leader.
__label__1	Fox News will be all over her for banning the media.
__label__-1	If its modeled after the health care bill, I actually dont have a problem with this, since THERE IS NO MANDATE IN THE HEALTH CARE BILL.
__label__-1	The Republican Iowa caucus choose Huckabee last time around, why is anybody surprised that the republican voters there are bat-shit crazy?
__label__-1	Chicken in my old lace
__label__-1	Great, when will Romney release the video full of Obama lies /circlejerk
__label__1	But get this, both parties are the same!
__label__-1	jesus christ... someone actually believed that they did?
__label__1	What a shock to see a politician abandon commitments and allegedly closely-held morals once in office.
__label__-1	If they're going to violate the 4th amendment, they might as well disregard every US law.
__label__1	Well to be fair... its sort of in their job description.
__label__1	Yeah, because that remark totally hasn't been mirrored hundreds of times by now.
__label__-1	Everything's bigger in Texas.
__label__1	HURF DURF IF U FORSE PEOPLE TO GET INNSURANCE THEY BY IT LOLZ IM A REPUBLICAN LOL IMPECH OBEMA
__label__-1	no shit
__label__1	Meh, shit happens.
__label__-1	Maybe that's why he retired.
__label__1	You don't need science to kill brown people
__label__-1	Fuck every single human being who isn't Donald J. Trump.
__label__1	Probably anti-semitism
__label__-1	It's a shame we can't bomb Climate Change.
__label__1	But it makes people feel good and isn't that whats really important.
__label__-1	He meant pro-life for sluts who need to feel the repercussions of their immoral life choices....not for him.
__label__1	Shocked, this isn't bigger news here on Reddit.
__label__1	Good, look at that face!
__label__-1	The NFL and the NBA should move their franchises.
__label__-1	I hope it is a push to get people treated, and not a push just to jail people.
__label__1	Well he did....except for that *one* time
__label__1	Just think if every single one of those people was an engineer, which is a realistic thing.
__label__1	I bet fox news's own Jesse Watters will be all over this story demanding answers as to why free speech is being infringed upon on college campuses.
__label__-1	no it's not.
__label__1	No, children should pay for K-12 education themselves, it's more efficient that way!
__label__-1	We must ban razor clams and bearded clams
__label__-1	A Very American Coup
__label__-1	sweet dude, but what does it matter?
__label__-1	4 of 4 Americans think polls can go to Hell.
__label__-1	$8000 deductibles
__label__-1	History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
__label__-1	Oh shut the fuck up
__label__-1	This was not a president-elect who is seeking to heal the divisions of this country, but one who is comfortable inflaming those divisions.
__label__1	Make Wall Street Great Again!
__label__1	Hey, he is an outsider who totally isnt corrupted
__label__-1	Seems like they are publicly playing the denial line for their population but behind the scenes they must be furious and feel that this is a direct shot at Chinese hegemony in the region.
__label__-1	Thanks for costing Gore the election
__label__1	"He is showing us how easy it is to be ""Presidential"""
__label__-1	Another harsh truth: super gullible people's votes count the same as everyone else's.
__label__-1	He can do that job with his eyes closed
__label__-1	Great diplomacy job, dipshit.
__label__1	"Until fuhrer Trump ends the idea of ""hate crimes"""
__label__1	Just like the Dems won in a landslide in 2010 because the voters wanted to punish the Republicans.
__label__1	Making America great again!
__label__-1	Trump has the empathy of Ted Bundy
__label__1	But wait, I thought liberals were the intolerant violent ones?
__label__1	All due to a decision that doesn't look suspicious at all.
__label__1	President of the United States sounds like a job that would have a good work-life balance
__label__-1	Auto downvote for Briebart enabled.
__label__-1	If this doesn't stop Trump from getting into office, nothing will.
__label__-1	So that's how Trump chose to show his gratitude towards Putin.
__label__1	unexpected
__label__-1	So brave
__label__1	Yes - but there were millions of uncounted votes that cost him the popular vote.
__label__1	But he's building a wall, so we're good.
__label__1	Isn't Hillary the bought candidate?
__label__1	Macedonia seems like where I'd first look for a credible report on this.
__label__1	More great America coming soon
__label__1	And that's the good news about Ms Conway.
__label__-1	sadly this is a pipe dream
__label__-1	I struggle to empathize with people like this.
__label__-1	Many wishful thinkers here.
__label__1	They clearly haven't seen one of the countless interviews where Kellyanne Conway informed us that Trump has a mandate.
__label__-1	Why do folks not respect the economic anxiety of high school students?
__label__-1	Meet Trump's New Best Bud.
__label__-1	Fake news site
__label__-1	And her lead in the electoral college, the thing that matters, hasn't changed.
__label__1	"It's cause they're the ""best people for the job."""
__label__1	Well, they wouldn't want to appoint a rapist.
__label__1	Fuck yeah, screw those blue collar jerks, it's not like they vote amirite fellas?
__label__1	All lives matter
__label__-1	So then what did the Russians hack or influence?
__label__1	Nah, it was Jill Stein's fault
__label__1	Yea, because polls are trustworthy
__label__-1	Could you point me to the e-mails posted on WikiLeaks, with direct links if you please, that exposes this presumably significant amount of corruption?
__label__1	But Trump had a rainbow flag, he's totally pro lgbt
__label__-1	Don't get arrested.
__label__-1	"""Partisan bullshit and nothing else spurred FBI to resume witch hunt when it'd do the most damage"" - Corrected headline."
__label__-1	When Trump is president, he'll be eating with the adults and all the crybaby dems can hang out at the kids table.
__label__1	But why not, she won the popular vote
__label__1	Trump won the popular vote, except for how he didn't.
__label__1	Well, Since he is King now I would advise him to advise them to just forget about that little loan.
__label__-1	If it's all fine then why the fuck do we need more nukes.
__label__-1	Of course not, he already didn't do his homework for the most difficult job interview in the world (the debates)
__label__1	But its against Jews so its not real terrorism
__label__-1	I wouldn't want to work at the UN but it still looks pretty cushy.
__label__-1	Subtle.
__label__1	It's called loyalty to their country, something Democrats wouldn't know anything about.
__label__1	Yeah when you count the three million illegals that voted for him
__label__1	Sounds like a good Christian man exercising his God-given right to make his wife submit to his status as the head of the household.
__label__-1	Didn't he say at the veterans forum he had too much respect for veterans to consider privatization.
__label__1	Not with Putin's help
__label__-1	The west coast should just fucking secede.
__label__1	Because giving all the power back to the insurance companies is going to be tremendous, believe me.
__label__1	Hey members of the Electoral College, Great Job carrying out your constitutional duty!
__label__-1	Didn't the CEO of said companies explicitly say that after a convo with Trump he's decided to bring back jobs?
__label__-1	Trump and the Republicans will kill Obamacare, but they are going to strap a time-bomb to it and kick it to the 2020 election (so that they can use it again).
__label__-1	The only voice of support left for Trump - The deranged ravings of the mentally ill
__label__-1	Saint Reagan raised taxes six times.
__label__1	wow what a national hero.
__label__-1	Strangely enough, this group is probably the least likely to know what Jesus taught from 1st hand reading of the New Testament.
__label__1	I'm sure American television will inform the public of this news.
__label__-1	"Instead of spending that money so we can go to Mars he'd rather spend it on sending the military to Iran to kill some more poor brown people so that the ""defense"" contractors can make their necessary millions."
__label__1	That's just the Free Market.
__label__-1	Well, it's a knee grow and they get special treatment.
__label__-1	*smile*
__label__-1	That is one amazing troll.
__label__1	Women should make it easy for themselves and marry a 60 year old guy, get pregnant repedetly and take their place in the kitchen.
__label__1	This is America land of the free, we have the constitution to protect our rights and freedoms, we DEMAND that these companies pay a specified wage that we think is sufficient, there's no room in this country for business to do whatever they want
__label__1	It's great that the sequester has not interfered with critical law enforcement efforts like this.
__label__1	Oh stop the whining, if you aren't rich, you aren't really a person.
__label__-1	It in fact did transform the world, but for the worse.
__label__1	Please take more of my rights!
__label__-1	Reality has a liberal bias?
__label__1	Yeah, but what about the whole fire and brimstone thing?
__label__1	This is a good strategy and certainly will not weaken America at all.
__label__-1	I get the impression that people are against voter IDs because those laws are coming from Republicans.
__label__-1	Keep it up, Repubs - keep fighting each other.
__label__-1	I choose attempting ransom arrested lrotearwea
__label__-1	Resubmitting because the mods removed the previous link because I added the actual lead in the title.
__label__1	What could go wrong?
__label__-1	that's a really strange stereotype you've constructed
__label__1	Bernie sanders is SUCH a warmonger!
__label__-1	Her foreign policy is extremely hawkish but lets wait for everyone to dismiss Breitbart instead of addressing the issue
__label__1	Highly unusual behavior for a Secretary of State, don't you think?
__label__-1	He means god told him.
__label__-1	hillary is a shameless bitch
__label__1	Sounds like just the kind of thing a Muslim would say.
__label__-1	How is it these legislators don't leave them selves open for law suits?
__label__1	Maybe a little golden crescent affixed to the exterior of their clothing
__label__-1	Says a voluntary survey.
__label__1	I wish this guy didn't care so much about us, its not very presidential.
__label__1	Lets dump more arms in the middle east that will solve the problem.
__label__1	What a surprise.
__label__-1	Bernie is moving in the right direction compared to the last Wash/ABC poll.
__label__-1	If the eventual democratic nominee doesn't win, I will eat my own ass.
__label__-1	**BREAKING NEWS** Wolf guarding henhouse is starting to eat chickens.
__label__-1	This is going to be an absolute shitshow, isn't it?
__label__-1	Only the fanatical religious who want to force their religious beliefs on everyone else want to see Roe vs Wade overturned.
__label__1	"Why would you think someone named Joey ""No Socks"" is connected?"
__label__-1	Ich Mexico pays for this Wall then there will surely be doors built Info it.
__label__1	Don't worry, He'll come around.
__label__1	Released just in time, too.
__label__-1	If the maternal care is better in Mexico maybe all of the illegal aliens in Texas should have their kids back there instead.
__label__1	Biden is just a sore loser.
__label__1	This seems to originate with a *Newsmax* piece so... Yup this *definitely* doesn't look like conservatives trying to deflect from the circus around the Russia problem and Trump's cabinet nominee confirmations.
__label__1	But Hillary was supposedly the corrupt one
__label__-1	God damn Trump is a stupid piece of shit.
__label__-1	And then say he never did it in a 666 character hell tweet.
__label__-1	this sub gets real excited for fake news
__label__-1	Just think, we have 4 or 8 years of this clown.
__label__1	Yeah, don't listen to his words, trust what's in his heart
__label__1	Putting the resources into the important things.
__label__1	You sure destroyed those liberals!
__label__1	But again, both sides are the same and Hillary's team and the DNC said mean things about Bernie in emails so it's everyone else's fault that Trump is going to do irreparable harm to this country and my vote for Jill Stein/write in for Bernie makes me pure as a fucking snowflake
__label__1	Emails- that's why
__label__-1	This from the man that all the way up to election night was calling Hillary in a landslide , Sorry his polls hold little respect with me
__label__1	And he doesn't have any connections to Russia!
__label__1	Trump's greatest sacrifice for America: he dodged the draft 5 times.
__label__-1	Well we're set to find out
__label__-1	"For being so ""small government "" GOP lawmakers sure seem to love telling poor people how to live"
__label__1	Boy, Trump is really getting ready to put us on the right track, huh?
__label__-1	"I feel like Russia is minuscule in terms of things Trump ""doesn't understand""."
__label__1	yes -- all five of them
__label__1	He's black so it's obviously obvious that his district is falling apart and crime infested.
__label__-1	Let me guess: James O'keefe exposes a group plotting criminal activity at Trump's inauguration, and that group is being led by...James O'Keefe!
__label__-1	What a surprise
__label__1	Typical Mac user thinking he's so special.
__label__1	Not bad for a gay kenyan dictator pussy muslim who supports ISIS
__label__1	He would have polled better if CNN hadn't included millions of illegal immigrants.
__label__-1	"More of those darn ""job killing regulations""."
__label__-1	Is this different than the ones that have been posted every day since the election?
__label__-1	I don't get it, when did republicans become so anti privacy?
__label__-1	How much have premiums increased since the ACA?
__label__1	All those idiots from Princeton University that got history degrees and social science degrees that are now working in finance... yeah, totally pointless.
__label__-1	Self censoring like this is just ignorant.
__label__1	Well, obviously it must be a fake poll result if it's from Fox news...
__label__-1	So he wont trample on the values of the majority.
__label__1	Which is why he won the Democratic Primary, naturally.
__label__-1	Michelle's disgusted look was worth the click.
__label__-1	Crybaby
__label__1	Dann liberals corrupting the penguins.
__label__1	Yeah let's just bend at the knee and not fight for what we believe in
__label__-1	Hate Trump or not, threatening to blow up the White House is a threat of terrorism, and does nothing to resolve issues in our country.
__label__-1	Well don't forget this when he runs for President in 2024.
__label__-1	Why are experts needed to verify this , I'm sure any 12 yr old with vision could call this out
__label__1	There has to be some form of punishment.
__label__-1	~~maga~~ manka
__label__1	Yes, they should capitulate and give trump everything with no resistance that will make democrats happy as the country goes to hell.
__label__1	But...but...e-mails!
__label__-1	Republicans seem to excel at bringing about recessions.
__label__-1	I believe a dictator is setting up and history is going to repeat itself :(
__label__1	Both sides are exactly the same amirite?
__label__-1	I miss the pre-alt-truth era.
__label__-1	This is from August of last year, why post it now?
__label__-1	This is getting so fucking ridiculous.
__label__-1	If she were a Republican making comments like that she'd be in Trump's cabinet by now.
__label__-1	Clearly we needed to put an end to this lunacy.
__label__1	Make America Rendition Again!
__label__-1	lol
__label__-1	Seriously , with all the thing wrong you worry about this shit , wtf is wrong with you people, get a fucking life and worry about things that actually matter
__label__-1	Wonder how Trump supporters will defend this
__label__-1	Lol good one bruh
__label__1	But hillary is the warhawk !
__label__-1	even she realizes she's outcrazied and outstupided
__label__1	Silent letters are FAKE NEWS
__label__1	He's mad about the Cubs winning.
__label__-1	their silence is very loud
__label__-1	"read the headline as ""trump dead"" thought everything was good"
__label__-1	damn, that's nearly 22 days of aid to israel, better stop that shit right now
__label__-1	"Thank god the founders of this country said its freedoms only applied to Christians... Can't have anyone else seek refuge in the ""free world."""
__label__1	Trump making America a safer place as he promised.
__label__1	Why does Bob Dylan's Masters of War get stuck in my head every time I read the news anymore?
__label__-1	Is this the alternative facts show I keep hearing about?
__label__-1	What a joke of a leader
__label__1	Failing Europe can't even do right wing populism right!
__label__1	Bill Clinton created Isis.
__label__1	Bannon is just MAGA,after all as Trump's brain he must also know more than Generals.
__label__-1	Will he resign if it doesn't work in a month, or 30 days, whichever comes first?
__label__1	Why 2 for 1 why not 3 for 1?
__label__-1	I hope the rest of the world steps up and implements sanctions on us.
__label__-1	Serious question: Can Delta sue Trump for this?
__label__1	But I thought he was the most friendly LGBT president of all-time!
__label__1	Yep, Mila is just another dirty, dangerous, anti-christian refugee.
__label__1	Soros and Trudeau created the plan over pizza and ping pong and then sacrificed a 9 year old to Hillary Clinton.
__label__1	He was obviously doing undercover research
__label__-1	Sounds like we need a travel ban on Trump supporters.
__label__1	I'm sure that will bring in more guests
__label__1	Welp, that was unexpected.
__label__1	Just like fundamentalist Saudi Arabia, why aren't the dangerously polite Canadians also subject to a travel ban to the US?
__label__1	Game of thrones leads me to believe it's trumps bastard child.
__label__1	Hmm idk, this report is kinda sketchy, it's from the Federal Bureau of Investigation which we know has a political agenda.
__label__-1	States rights.
__label__-1	Why does the GOP hate bald eagles so much?
__label__-1	The kind Trump brags about?
__label__1	He was too busy being pro-gay, obv!
__label__-1	Another form of regressive taxation by Republicans.
__label__-1	So will the bias of facts he falls victim to so often.
__label__-1	Chris with the Mexican television
__label__1	Yes, he has totally redeemed himself.
__label__-1	And how many people died?
__label__1	Everybody knows those surpluses were caused by Reagan.
__label__-1	Man that woman who is pictured for the article looks like SUCH a bitch.
__label__1	Voter fraud, voter fraud
__label__1	Because public schools have done an amazing job thanks to huge expansions of the department of education over the last few decades.
__label__-1	I wish I was smart enough to understand what he means.
__label__-1	stay classy SC
__label__-1	I guess that's one round about way of saying WELFARE is a problem.
__label__1	But wouldn't that be a kind of violating the officers right to privacy?
__label__1	A $xx,xxx,xxx.xx fine and admitting no wrong doing is the solution to this problem.
__label__-1	Remove sim card, put in airplane mode...record at will
__label__-1	One down, several thousand to go.
__label__-1	Who watches the watchers?
__label__1	Chill out, its just meta data anyways
__label__1	That's totally what Jesus would do.
__label__1	Because when you're elected to PUBLIC office, you should really only give a shit about the people that voted for you.
__label__1	Only because they would have felt slighted if they didn't.
__label__-1	The next administration will be voted in by the people that want cannabis legalized federally!
__label__1	trust me, it's different this time
__label__-1	And Mexican people are most likely to get all the money from it
__label__-1	X-post to /nottheonion?
__label__-1	(I generally can't stand Reason and CATO, but they're right about stuff like this and police abuse issues generally.)
__label__-1	I like and get what you're saying, but did the company that owned the store release it, or did the actual city?
__label__-1	So, not a chance then?
__label__-1	Thats the free market for ya!
__label__1	Proof that Christians are being persecuted.
__label__-1	He's a fascist poser?
__label__-1	Arbeit macht frei.
__label__-1	and gains in the polls
__label__-1	What about the liberty of the rest of us Americans who don't want to get shot by a radical gun nut (or the thief who stole the gun nut's gun)?
__label__1	Well of course he'd say that, he is a Muslim!
__label__-1	such a quick conversion
__label__1	Because if there is one thing worth clawing back it's people's Civil Rights!
__label__1	About fucking time someone stood up to the electorate.
__label__1	vote democrat, because its not voting against yourself
__label__-1	I'm not even going to point out the irony here.
__label__-1	Look at wiikileaks, also its not just solar.
__label__1	dat makes him smart
__label__1	This article must be wrong because my Comrade (who is a Party member in good standing) said in his inauguration speech that he would never lie to us.
__label__-1	We're all so screwed.
__label__-1	This sub might as well be buzz feed
__label__1	I'm sure Trump would be just as upset if Bill Maher or Arianna Huffington wasn't allowed to speak at Berkeley and he'd do the same thing he's doing now.
__label__1	He needs his safe space!
__label__1	a 19% stake in an oil company and other bits and bobs such as a presidency and some call girls.
__label__-1	Czar Trump is at it again.
__label__-1	Running out of relevant narratives, are we now?
__label__-1	That is stupid, her hands are too big.
__label__-1	CBS huh, What a surprise!
__label__1	Fake news
__label__-1	Another reason to oppose DeVos.
__label__1	Oh well in that case, yeah go ahead kill all the civilians you want Donald.
__label__-1	"""We know he has done his fair share of Jew hating..."""
__label__1	Well, that's comforting.
__label__-1	That title is very confusing
__label__1	Odd that a group backing his opposition would come to that conclusion.
__label__-1	How do Trump Supporters respond to this?
__label__-1	They will pay for insulting Putin's Tsarina.
__label__1	"""It was in nothing I read."""
__label__-1	Any vets who voted for him wanna defend this shit?
__label__1	"""Period!"""
__label__1	"It is a good thing we didn't elect the ""corrupt"" candidate."
__label__1	The destruction will continue until America is great again.
__label__1	I won't believe this story is true until I see it in Breitbart
__label__-1	Whatever happened to privacy?
__label__1	I see no issues with that according to a GOP spokesman, but if Hillary tried that she should be charged with treason.
__label__-1	it's almost like these executive orders are being written by the guy who used to run Breitbart News and a 31 year-old staffer with no input from experts on how they can be crafted to avoid legal challenges.
__label__1	But he's such a good and decent man and we always jerk each other off when we are on the treadmills watching Morning Joe.
__label__1	Maybe this way he'll ironically end up making America great again.
__label__-1	The GOP's voted suppression, FBI and foreign nation interference and Hillary getting 3,000,000 more votes calls his legitimacy into question.
__label__1	Sounds like a lovely idea
__label__-1	Poor Canada.
__label__-1	Was this the guy behind the atlanta attack Spicer referenced?
__label__1	All these justices must have been horrible high school students.
__label__-1	Lock her up!
__label__1	It's a conspiracy!
__label__1	Super awesome source, OP
__label__-1	you hit the nail on the head here
__label__-1	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
__label__1	Gates' family population control plans confirmed
__label__-1	Treason is such an ugly word.
__label__1	We really dodged a bullet by not electing the candidate with all those emails.
__label__-1	we never win anymore!
__label__-1	"""hurr its the jews durr"""
__label__1	Unlike all those other administrations who publicly stated their desire for war in the Middle East.
__label__1	Hold up You saying that after escaping war these refugees were not simply prowling the streets in huge gangs trying to rape white women and that the police and government were not giving them a free all-you can-rape pass?
__label__1	So you're saying he never divested...........I'm shocked
__label__-1	Russia can take President Trump.
__label__1	Does anyone know if Trump won the election?
__label__1	Well obviously this must be fake news because Our Leader said so
__label__1	Yeah but why didn't they send any random black person in the White House to just set up a meeting?
__label__-1	WTF is California Bill ?
__label__1	Is Comey going to go on TV and read a letter now about no charges?
__label__1	Well Trump did say yesterday that he inherited a mess so what can you really expect
__label__1	Because no one in the Trump regime would ever tell a lie
__label__1	Yeah but you only have a job as a paid shill on Reddit
__label__-1	*Only* 37?
__label__-1	Ron Mexico and Carlos Danger are at it again
__label__-1	He gave Trump a huge what?
__label__-1	Lol shills
__label__-1	This story just gets juicier and juicer.
__label__-1	This is one of the most poorly written articles I've ever read.
__label__1	It's not a vacation It's the winter White House You people in the media are just making stuff up
__label__-1	Florida man issues unconstitutional executive order
__label__1	Ugh, what a nerd.
__label__1	It's crazy how one man is able to be #1 in the world at so many things.
__label__-1	Doesn't she have secret service guys hanging around still?
__label__-1	Goddamn globalists.
__label__-1	NASA is, of course, on time.
__label__1	that is the one thing i learned about people , they love doing more with less, it's a challenge.
__label__-1	What did he have to say about mass murder in Muslim mosque?
__label__-1	This really bothers me.
__label__-1	It's just too bad he can't avoid public appearances like all the other incompetent politicians seem to be trying to do.
__label__1	Fake city council!
__label__1	He loves the LGBTQ community, thats why he is doing this.
__label__-1	Got to keep the bigots that voted for him happy while Congress takes away their health care coverage.
__label__-1	This is funny!
__label__1	Waiting for my taxes to go down.
__label__-1	I wouldn't believe a word of this, except we're in Crazy World now, where this story makes perfect sense.
__label__1	Yeah, those coastal elites **love** Europe.
__label__1	Well it's a good thing we're cutting PBS or this might have been a problem
__label__-1	Hook 'em Horns!
__label__-1	Holy shit, that is how Mexicans will pay for the wall....they will literally build it as detained prisoners.
__label__1	Wow, hundreds of scientists, that's like, 0.001%, must be true therefor.
__label__-1	trump fans or planted trolls, like the black person dressed up as a kkk member at a trump rally during the election?
__label__1	McCain is concerned.
__label__1	Yeah 53% of all Americans
__label__1	This guy was not extremely vetted!
__label__1	Whoa, whoa, but let's not jump to any conclusions about the motive, it could be anything!
__label__1	It's the price we must pay for Tump's de-globlization which will bring union jobs and high tech firms back to MAGA.
__label__-1	Yeah because he won't win reelection in 2018, he's a hack
__label__-1	Low energy, low courage.
__label__1	I'm sure Fox News will interview this father as much as they interviewed the mother of the Benghazi Navy Seal.
__label__-1	"""Make America's Rivers Burn Again"""
__label__1	Oh shit we found the smoking gun.
__label__-1	He's just going to say the economy is going to grow so rapidly under him that increasing spending won't increase the deficit.
__label__1	Trump is the healthiest President to ever take office, so he doesn't have to worry about that.
__label__-1	War is a racket.
__label__1	This is how you bring the country back together again.
__label__-1	There sure is a pretty big and coordinated attempt at cover up of nothing.
__label__-1	That's not weird, he's trying to deflect.
__label__-1	In Soviet America, Russia elects you!
__label__1	Ah, the good old days.
__label__1	Yeah but he knows more than the generals do.
__label__1	But are we sure the shooter wasn't just another liberal trying to make Trump look bad?
__label__1	"""I'm the least racist, literally the least anti-Semitic, if there was a competition for most loving leader, it would be me, totally, ok just believe me ok."""
__label__1	damn jews
__label__-1	Short, to the point, optional, and pays for itself... I like this.
__label__-1	Not sure when the last time I saw someone in riot gear was.
__label__-1	Sure... but what about the theft of service (power) and the guns?
__label__1	Media Matters, now there's an honest website
__label__-1	"Anybody here remember the movie ""Brazil""?"
__label__1	Harr harr generalizations are so fucking FUNNY!
__label__-1	So, King_Rajesh - you don't think there is a difference between when a sitting president criticizes another branch of government and when a popular radio host does it?
__label__-1	another reason to hate republicans
__label__-1	how is this politics?
__label__1	Well at least that money isn't going towards a hateful Islamist school or something.
__label__-1	Yes, the moment of silence about Brits that they didn't show was so much more worldly than the Parade of Nations that they did show.
__label__-1	Well, funny story, Mitt Romney is a moron.
__label__1	Great job wasting the tax payers money on something that will be thrown out by the courts NC!
__label__1	No one has ever gone to jail for standing up for what's right.
__label__1	Just make it 1000 dollars an hour this will obviously fix all problems.
__label__-1	If the author of the article were secretly a libertarian posing as opponents and writing stuff trying to make their opponents look silly, then how would we know?
__label__1	war =profits you silly bunny- feeding the poors is like throwing money away
__label__-1	I'm pretty sure politicians have figured out they can just lie to everyone and when they are corrected no one will be listening
__label__-1	So no mandatory drug tests?
__label__1	"I'm soooo confident that the letter and spirit of the 4th Amendment will be front and center throughout their deliberations, and that our wise senators will be unaffected by unfounded cries of ""but teh terrorists are gonna keeeel us all dead without dragnet surveillance!!!"""
__label__-1	Anything except actually changing their policies.
__label__1	theres no proof of that
__label__-1	I'm curious as to how much this investigation cost the taxpayer.
__label__1	That'll work sooo well
__label__-1	Obama knows does not want Janet Reno type crisis on his hands that why?
__label__1	yea and hillary wont be able to run in prison.
__label__1	How dare you attack a fine American patriot like that?
__label__-1	Lol It's like Veep, but instead of loveable JLD you have a cunt donkey!
__label__1	Man... i wonder which party is going to make this an issue?
__label__-1	like wallstreet CEOs, they probably did something wrong generalizing is fun
__label__-1	WATERGATE!
__label__-1	Spoken like a true 5yr old
__label__-1	I loved the part where Bernie slapped that guy
__label__-1	FYI: LIfezette is run by Laura Ingraham who is one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders.
__label__1	$5m each is a small price to pay.
__label__1	Clearly they fired it at themselves
__label__-1	Is there some way I can thank him for his donation?
__label__1	Don't worry, Jesus will protect us!
__label__1	"Carson, as a former surgeon, will sure know how ""cut"" HUD down to Trump's size."
__label__-1	Because Republicans NEVER say mean things.
__label__1	But Trump knew nothing about it.
__label__1	They deserved it because they're a blue state.
__label__1	"Maybe they all remember talking to Kislyak, they just didn't know he was a ""Russian""."
__label__-1	Wow, he shut up for 24 hours?
__label__-1	It'd be nice but don't hold your breath.
__label__1	Securing the board with a wall makes them redundant.
__label__1	Flynn resigning and Sessions reusing himself is all make believe!
__label__-1	But what does President Bannon think?
__label__1	But I thought this was always only about creating American jobs.
__label__-1	can't wait to see Spicy get up there and defend Breitbart as real news
__label__1	Because banning Iraqi's was totally the issue everyone had with the first travel ban
__label__-1	There's a Russian official in the US, they can take care of... Just saying
__label__1	Oh well that settles that then.
__label__-1	I'm fully in support of raising the highest tax bracket back up to 90% like it was in the 20s
__label__-1	That photo is incredibly sad.
__label__-1	Correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't the Coast Guard an important part of border protection?
__label__-1	Didn't work here.
__label__1	His brilliant idea as permanent head of NSC really working out!
__label__-1	Rebublicare: Just fucking die, you poor shits!
__label__1	Bannon says there's nothing to this story, so that must be the truth.
__label__1	Details are bullshit!
__label__-1	I think Governors may get bribed by a different set of people than congressmen, so their pleas may fall on deaf ears.
__label__1	But look at all those jobs they're creating though
__label__-1	Except for those brief stolen moments of raw passion as their bodies seemed to collide from across the foyer before tumbling into the utility closet
__label__1	Are they tired of winning already?
__label__1	Yeah because fuck the poor and middle class miright?
__label__-1	"""A riddle wrapped in an enigma..."""
__label__-1	Wow and to think a border wall would be four times more expensive
__label__-1	"'Critics pound auto manufacturer after dispute that vehicles don't run on gasoline, but ""gremlin farts""' 'Critics pound FDA over statement that calories don't exist, more french fries at 11' 'Critics pound heavyweight boxer over statements condemning violence in sports' 'Critics pound literature professor for saying all books are the same, and boring' 'Critics pound Agriculture head over statement that Gatorade is all plants need'"
__label__-1	Supply Side Jesus approves.
__label__-1	Most oppose it - just the devoid of empathy type of conservatives with their war against America are for it.
__label__1	you can't charge a president and a vice president for the same crime
__label__1	This is hard to believe.
__label__-1	i think Trumps Administration is making fools of gullible trump supporters...just as so many people said they would!
__label__1	Is twenty million many?
__label__1	"They misspelled ""unpresidented"""
__label__1	And we're a'comin' for your women folk!
__label__-1	"""Do as I say, NOT as I DO..."""
__label__-1	What happened to state's rights?
__label__1	no, because a response would be RACISM.
__label__1	The tension and anticipation they are building with this wait time is incredible
__label__1	He already showed a couple pages of a tax return, that's enough work for one month
__label__1	Yeah but he couldn't have won the election because he lost the primaries.
__label__-1	Kellyanne ?
__label__-1	Simply put, Donald Trump is an evil man.
__label__-1	They want to cut everything.
__label__-1	Those poor blue collar million/billionaires
__label__1	I wonder if it has to do with his drunk tweets about his back end connections with Wikileaks which totally have nothing to do with Russia
__label__-1	Lol
__label__-1	How else could he afford it?
__label__-1	He'd rather just take shots at Obama for all the vacations he took.
__label__1	Obviously he's making his annual hush money payment to the Registrar's office for faking his birth certificate all those years ago.
__label__1	But the jet tho
__label__-1	For the first time in my life I have respect for One Direction
__label__-1	Perhaps you should practice what you preach
__label__-1	We all knew that was coming
__label__-1	Why doesn't he get charged when he diverts from doing the business of the US people/
__label__1	Yeah, Trump just loves veterans.
__label__1	He's prolly not sad though, when you have a nickname of President behind the actual President that's pretty good.
__label__-1	Are they trying to fuck technology companies here: no laptops, no tablets.
__label__1	This is definitely not hateful at all
__label__1	Um sorry I don't listen to paid shills who spout out obviously fake news
__label__-1	It's like local news Weather on the 1's but with treason.
__label__-1	I sure hope it's to figure out Donald's exile plans, swarmy pieces of shit.
__label__-1	Tiny little man makes empty threats.
__label__-1	I feel bad for the poor soul that has to be the guard for the Trump-Jones jail cell.
__label__1	Wow, the most transparent admin ever!
__label__-1	WTF I hate space now!
__label__1	The suspects were illegal immigrants so based on that one instance all illegal immigrants need to go!
__label__-1	So who leaked this?
__label__1	"next Trump will reveal to us that few people know that Lincoln used to love eating at ""Lincoln's Waffle Shop"" across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe on 10th street near where the busses drop off all the tourists for (the very famous) Ford's Theater."
__label__-1	Only when still in the womb.
__label__-1	Is this possibly in contempt of a court order?
__label__-1	I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out Alex Jones did something illegal for cash.
__label__1	Well if he apologized for obstruction of justice, all is fine then?
__label__1	Duh, has he been wrong yet as president?
__label__1	Bigly
__label__1	There's no evidence but yeah let's shut down the government to please the California democrats
__label__1	Trump has soooo much political capital right now !
__label__1	Wait, I thought only Clinton used e-mail?
__label__1	Its all George Soros' doing!
__label__-1	Who knew all the jobs created would be for investigators.
__label__-1	Carcetti is a real motherfucker.
__label__-1	that title sounds like trump wrote it.
__label__-1	This goes way to far into the realm of crazy conspiracy theories.
__label__1	Must be a very impartial list.
__label__-1	The fact the the Chetto gets riled reading newspapers, I wish he would visit here and find out how we really feel about him.
__label__-1	That's how he made it so far
__label__1	That totally doesn't look suspect at all
__label__1	Truly a man of the people.
__label__1	Could this be the beginning of the end for Trump?
__label__1	But this will cause all the millionaires and billionaires to flee California for more tax friendly states!
__label__1	I mean, it makes sense, we've just elected two Presidents in a row who are nonreligious as far as I can tell.
__label__-1	Russian bank is not the Russian government, idiot.
__label__1	Which is because none of the major sports stadiums are built in Real America
__label__-1	The fix is in.
__label__-1	why does he even say these things?
__label__1	Good thing Republicans argue for State's Rights!
__label__1	This... was unforeseeable.
